		<h1>Superpowers and Abilities Ranked</h1>
		<p>Welcome to every superpower and supernatural ability ranked by me. These powers are ranked based on every day life so
		many variables will play a role in ranking.</p>
		<p>Every skill will be split into three categories, Main Skills which are skills that define ones character, Subskills or skills that are 
		used alongside the main skill in characters, and passive skills which are techniques, resistances or characteristics that are used
		regularly.
		
		<h1>Ranking Letters</h1>
		<p>S+ --> S --> S- (Exceeding)</p>
		<p>A+ --> A --> A-  (Perfect)</p>
		<p>B+ --> B--> B-  (Great)</p>
		<p>C+ --> C --> C- (Satisfactory)</p>
		<p>D+ --> D --> D- (Neutral/Lacking)</p>
		<p>E+ --> E--> E- (Kind of Useless)</p>
		<p>F+ --> F --> F- (Very Bad/Useless)</p>

		characters already do have a healing factor.
		
		<h3>Independant Variables:</h3>
		<p>Conditions - Some characters that have healing factor would need a certain substance, environment, feeling, etc.</p>
		<p>Combat Frequency - The more you fight/train, the more helpful a healing factor is</p>
		<p> Speed - The speed of regeneration could play a massive role in usefulness</p>

		<p>Ranking:</p>
		<p>Usability --> A+</p>
		<p>Combat Usage --> S</p>
		<p>Destruction --> F-</p>
		<p>Utility --> B+ </p>
		<p>Overall --> B+ or A-</p>
