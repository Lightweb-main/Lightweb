		<h1>Piecewise Functions</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Piecewise functions are functions that are broken up into pieces. This can create irregular slopes and lines that a linear line wouldn't normally produce...

		Piecewise functions usually have limitations or greater than or less than statements that create the pieces of a piecewise function. For example...

	This basically tells us that the piecewise function is made out of two seperate function lines. One that's has a slope of 1 and only appears when x is less than 0...
	<img src="../Images/PieceFunc.img2.png">
	And another with a slope thats also 1, has a y-intercept of -2 and only appears when x is greater than or equal to 0...
	<img src="../Images/PieceFunc.img3.png">
	So taking these together, we can graph the piecewise functions with both of these lines.
