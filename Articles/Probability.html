		<h1>Probability</h1> 
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The Probability of an event/phenomenon is basically how likely it is to occur. So for example, a coin has two sides, heads and tails. The chances of a coin flip landing on tails is 50 percent, which makes the chances of landing on hands also 50 percent.
    <h2>Theoretical Probability</h2>
    Theoretical Probability is the probability of an outcome calculated with mathematics. For example, a die (singular for dice) usually has 6 sides, all having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dots. Now to calculate the probability of landing on 5, divide the amount of favorable outcomes (in this case 1) by the total amount of outcomes (in this case 6)...
