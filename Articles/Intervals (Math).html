	<h1>Intervals (Math)</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Intervals in mathematics are <a style="border: none; font-size: 14px;" href="Set%20Theory.html">sets</a> that contain numbers that are in between two numbers called endpoints. An example of an interval would be numbers between 1 to 10...
	<p>1 to 10 = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}</p>
	Notation for intervals can depend on the type of interval it is. Like how (Open Intervals are enclosed in Parentheses). Intervals can also have endpoints that are infinite
	<h2>Type of Intervals</h2>
	There are a few type of intervals that can either include or exclude the starting numbers.
	<h3>Open Intervals</h3>
	Open Intervals don't contain the endpoint numbers so from the previous example, 1 and 10 aren't included...
	<p>4 to 7 = 5, 6</p>
	Open intervals are noted with (parantheses around them)...
	<p>(-9, 1) = -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0</p>

	<h3>Closed Intervals</h3>
	Closed Interval do contain the endpoint numbers, they are instead noted with [sqaure brackets]...
	<p>[-9, 1] = -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1</p>

	<h3>Half closed, half open / Half open, half closed</h3>
	Sometimes an Interval can be half closed half open or the other way around like these...
	<p>[1, 3)</p>
	<p>(4, 11]</p>
	<p>[6, 9)</p>
	This basically means that one endpoint won't be included and the other will...
	<p>[3, 9) = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</p>
