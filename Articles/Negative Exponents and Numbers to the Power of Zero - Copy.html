		<h1 style="font-size: 50;">Negative Exponents & Numbers to the Power of Zero</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Powers are numbers that are multiplied by themselves a number of times like this one…
<p>2<sup>3</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2</p>
But the exponent, which is the small number above and to the right of the base can be negative…
<p>2<sup>-4</sup> </p>
And a base can have an exponent that is 0…</p>
<p>2<sup>0</sup> = 2 * 0 ???</p>
<h2>Numbers to the Power of Zero</h2>
When a number is to the power of zero, it doesn’t equal zero since 0 can’t equal any number except itself. The rule when a number is to the power of zero is that it always equals 1 no matter how big or small it is…
<p>2<sup>0</sup> = 1</p>
<p>1,000,000,000,000<sup>0</sup> = 1</p>
<p>0.0000000001<sup>0</sup> = 1</p>
Even powers to other powers to the power of zero equals 1…</p>
<p>((x<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3000</sup>)<sup><sup>0</sup></sup> = 1</p>
In conclusion, every number to the power of zero equals 1…</p>
<p>x<sup>0</sup> = 1</p>

<h2>Number to the Power of Negative Numbers</h2>
When a number is to the power of a negative number. It is the reciprocal of the power that has the opposite exponent…
<p>3<sup>-3</sup> = 1/3<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>x<sup>-a</sup> = 1/x<sup>a</sup></p>
So for example 4 to the power of -2…
<p>4<sup>-2</sup></p>
This power is the reciprocal of 4 to the power of 2 which is 16…
<p>4<sup>-2</sup> = 1/4<sup>2</sup>
<p>= 1/16</p>
So 4 to the power of -2 is 1/16 since 4 to the power of positive 2 is 16 and a power with a negative exponent is the reciprocal of itself with the opposite exponent.

Negative exponents can also be shown as a fraction like 5 to the power of -9…
<p>5<sup>-9</sup></p>
We can just say that this is 1 divided by 5 to the power of 9…
<p>5<sup>-9</sup> = 1 / 5<sup>9</sup></p>
It can also be used for variables as well…
<p>x<sup>8</sup>y<sup>-9</sup> = x<sup>8</sup> / y<sup>9</sup></p>
Even with numbers and with variables…
<p>h<sup>12</sup>t<sup>-23</sup>10<sup>4</sup> = h<sup>12</sup>10<sup>4</sup> / t<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>= 10000h<sup>12</sup> / t<sup>23</sup></p>
Powers with positive exponents go on the top while the powers with negative exponents go on the bottom.
