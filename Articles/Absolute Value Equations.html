	<h1>Absolute Value Equations</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Absolute equations are equations that contain the absolute value of a number (s) like this one…<br>
	<p>|2x - 4| = 18</p>
	This example is a multi-step Absolute Equation. To solve an Absolute Equation, take a look at it. In this equation the absolute value of 2x - 4 equals 18. In an Absolute Equation, there are two solutions. Like for the example above, we can turn it into two separate equations…
	<p>|2x - 4| = 18</p>
	We can simply remove the vertical lines and solve…
	<p>2x - 4 = 18</p>
	<p>2x = 22</p>
	<p>x = 11</p>
	Or we can remove the vertical lines, make the sum negative and solve…
	<p>2x - 4 = -18</p>
	<p>2x = -14</p>
	<p>x = -7</p>
	But what if two absolute values are equal to each other…
	<p>|2x - 4| =  |4x + 2|</p>
	We can remove the two pairs of vertical lines…
	<p>2x - 4 = 4x + 2 </p>
	<p>2x = 4x + 6</p>
	<p>-2x = 6</p>
	<p>x = -3</p>
	And for the second solution, we would remove the first pair of vertical lines on the left and make the equation on the right negative…
	<p>2x - 4 = -4x - 2</p>
	<p>2x = -4x + 2</p>
	<p>6x = 2</p>
	<p>x = 2/6 = 1/3</p>
The two solutions for this equation are ⅓ and 1.

What if there is multiplication…
	<p>3|x - 2| =  26</p>
Divide both sides by 3…
	<p>|x - 2| = 26/3</p>
We can find out the two solutions…
	<p>x - 2 = 26/3</p>
	<p>x - 2 = -26/3</p>

	<p>x = 32/3</p>
	<p>x = -20/3</p>
But what if there are two absolute values on one side…
	<p>|3x + 3| + |-4x - 2| = 24</p>
We can move one of the absolute values over to the other side…
	<p>-4x - 2 = 24 + 3x + 3</p>
	<p>-4x - 2 = 3x + 27</p>
	<p>-7x - 2 = 27</p>
	<p>-<p>7x = 29</p>
	<p>x = -29/7</p>

	<p>3x + 3 = 24 - 4x - 2</p>
	<p>3x = 21 - 4x - 2</p>
	<p>3x = 19 - 4x</p>
	<p>7x = 19</p>
	<p>x = 19/7</p>

	<p>x = -29/7, 19/7</p>
But what if the question is an inequality with an absolute value…
	<p>|x + 2| < 16</p>
We can remove the vertical lines and keep the sign the same…
	<p>x + 2 < 16</p>
	<p>x < 14</p>
And we can remove the vertical lines, switch the sign, and switch the numbers sign…
	<p>x + 2 > -16</p>
	<p>x > -18</p>

The final answer is…
	<p>-18 < x < 14</p>
What about the sign pointing the other way…
	<p>|3x - 5| > 16</p>
Remove the vertical signs and solve…
	<p>3x - 5 > 16</p>
	<p>3x > 21</p>
	<p>x > 7</p>
And do the same for the next but switch the sign around and the numbers sign …
	<p>3x - 5 < -16</p>
	<p>3x < -11</p>
	<p>x < -11/3</p>
Unlike absolute equations where the sign is like this “<” instead of this “>”, x could either be smaller than -11/3 or bigger than 7, it’s not in between…
	<p>7 < x < -11/3 INVALID EQUATION</p>
	<p>x > 7          or        x  < -11/3</p>


But what if there are two absolute values and the question is an inequality…
	<p>|5x - 7| + |3x + 2| < 18</p>
Turn the less than sign into an equal sign…
	<p>|5x - 7| + |3x + 2| = 18</p>
Solve normally…
Move one of the values to the other side and switch its signs.
	<p>3x + 2 = 18 - 5x + 7</p>
	<p>3x = 18 - 5x + 5</p>
	<p>8x = 23</p>
	<p>x = 23/8</p>

Move the other value to the other side and switch its signs.
	<p>3x + 2 = 5x - 7 + 18</p>
	<p>3x + 2 = 5x + 11</p>
	<p>3x + 2 = -5x - 11</p>
	<p>3x = -5x - 13</p>
	<p>8x = -13</p>
	<p>x = -13/8</p>
Put the smaller number first…
	<p>-13/8 </p>
The smallest number goes last…
	<p>-13/8 > x > 23/8</p>

<h2>Why do Absolute Equations have 2 Solutions?</h2>
Absolute Equations have two solutions because absolute values are a distance metric, meaning that both a positive and negative value both result in a positive, absolute value…
	<p>|x| = |-x|</p>
This applies to multi-step absolute equations where two solutions can be found.<br><br>
