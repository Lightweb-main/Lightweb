		<h1>Imaginary Numbers</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Imaginary numbers are unreal numbers which cannot be correctly shown with positive and negative values. An example of an imaginary number is the square root of negative 1…
<p>&radic;-1 = ???</p>
There is no root to a negative number because no number multiplied by itself can equal a negative number. Meaning that the answer to this equation isn’t real. This is why the letter, “i” or “iota” (or the imaginary unit) and its value is in fact the square root of negative 1…
<p>&radic;-1 = i</p>
Imaginary numbers are usually numbers as coefficients…
<p>4i = 4 &radic;-1</p>
<p>-3i = -3 &radic;-1</p>
<p>9i = 9 &radic;-1</p>
Another way to interpret imaginary numbers is that i squared equals a negative number…
<p>i<sup>2</sup> = negative number </p>
Powers of Iota
When iota is raised to a certain power, it sometimes may have the same value as other powers like this…
<p>i1 = &radic;-1</p>
<p>i<sup>2</sup> = -1</p>
<p>i<sup>3</sup> = -&radic;-1 = -i</p>
<p>i<sup>4</sup> = 1</p>
<p>i<sup>5</sup> = &radic;-1</p>
<p>i<sup>6</sup> = -1</p>
<p>i<sup>7</sup> = -&radic;-1 = -i</p>
Notice how iota to the power of 5 equals iota to the power of 1. That’s because the value of the power of iota is dependent on the remainder of the exponent divided by 4 if it is greater than four…
<p>i<sup>12</sup> = ???</p>
<p>12 / 4 = 3 R: 0</p>
<p>i<sup>12</sup> = 1</p>
If the remainder of the exponent divided by four is 0, then the power is equal to the power of 4 which is 1…
<p>i<sup>240</sup> = ???</p>
<p>240 / 4 = 60 R: 0</p>
<p>i<sup>240</sup> =  1</p>

<p>i<sup>712</sup> = ???</p>
<p>712 / 4 = 153</p>
<p>i<sup>712</sup> = 1</p>
If the remainder is equal to 1, 2 or 3, that means that the power is equal to iota to the power of 1, 2, or 3…
<p>i<sup>182</sup> = </p>
<p>182 / 4 = 45 R: 2</p>
<p>i<sup>182</sup> = &radic;-1 = i<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>i<sup>349</sup> = </p>
<p>349 / 4 = 87 R: 1</p>
<p>i<sup>349</sup> = &radic;-1 = i1</p>
<p>i<sup>8123</sup> = </p>
<p>8123 / 4 = 2030 R: 3</p>
<p>i<sup>8123</sup> = -i</p>
So basically you just divide the exponent by four and find the value of the power, which is iota to the power of the reminder.

Equations with Imaginary Numbers
Math can also be performed with numbers with the imaginary unit…
<p>(3i)<sup>3</sup> = ???</p>
We would use the distributive property to find the value of this equation…
<p>3<sup>3</sup> * i<sup>3</sup> = 27 * i<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>= -27 &radic;-1</p>
<p>So (3i)<sup>3</sup> is -27 times the square root of &radic;-1. </p>
