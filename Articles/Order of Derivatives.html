		<h1>Order of Derivatives</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Order of derivatives is the repeating process of differentiation…
<p>f’(x) = 4x<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>f’’(x) = 12x<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>f’’’(x) = 24x</p>
Higher order derivatives are functions that have been derived multiple times, as in the example above, the functions first derivative is 4x<sup>3</sup>, the functions second derivative is 12x<sup>2</sup>, and the functions third derivative is 24x. The derivatives are noted in order like the first, second, third, and forth derivative. The function itself will have multiple apostrophes to show that it is being derived multiple times…
<p>f(x) = 3x<sup>5</sup> = 3x<sup>5</sup> - 0.5 = 3x<sup>4.5</sup></p>
<p>f’(x) = 13.5x<sup>3.5</sup></p>
<p>f’’(x) = 47.25x<sup>2.5</sup></p>
<p>f’’’(x) = 118.125<sup>1.5</sup></p>
<p>f’’’’(x) = 177.1875<sup>0.5</sup></p>
The amount of apostrophes is the amount the function is derived…
<p>f’’(x) = Second Derivative</p>
<p>f’’’(x) = Third Derivative</p>
<p>f’(x) = First Derivative</p>
Higher order derivatives can also be shown as d/dx…
<p>d<sup>2</sup>/dx<sup>2</sup> = d/dx(d/dx(3x<sup>6</sup>)</p>
<p>= d/dx(18x<sup>5</sup>)</p>
<p>= 90x<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>d<sup>3</sup>/dx<sup>3</sup> = d/dx(d/dx(d/dx(f(x))))</p>
<p>d<sup>4</sup>/dx<sup>4</sup>(6x<sup>5</sup>) = d/dx(d/dx(d/dx(d/dx(6x<sup>5</sup>))))</p>
<p>= d/dx(d/dx(d/dx(30x<sup>4</sup>)</p>
<p>= d/dx(d/dx(120x<sup>3</sup>)</p>
<p>= d/dx(360x<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p>= 720x</p>
