		<h1>The Milankovitch Cycles</h1>
		<h2>Introduction </h2>
The Milankovitch cycles are periodic shifts in the Earth’s orbit around the sun and its axial tilt. The Milankovitch Cycles consist of three main types of changes, Eccentricity, Obliquity, and Precession. The Milankovitch cycles have a huge impact on the climate of the Earth. 

		<h2>Eccentricity</h2>
The orbit of Earth isn’t perfectly circular, however it sometimes gets close but it slowly shifts into a more elliptical orbit. Eccentricity is the shape of the Earth’s orbit. The Earth’s orbit isn’t perfectly circular since the two largest gas giants in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, pull Earth’s orbit around the sun to be more elliptical or circular. This is because the two gas giants have an immense pull of gravity which then alters Earth’s orbit over time. Eccentricity is the reason why our four seasons on Earth have different lengths. For example, winters in the northern hemisphere are 4 and a half days shorter than summers and springs are 3 days longer than autumns. Over time, when the Eccentricity decreases, the difference between these seasons slowly evens out. The closest that the Earth is to the sun is called the perihelion which is usually on January 3rd every year, and when the Earth is the farthest from the sun which is usually on July 4, is called the aphelion. During the aphelion, the Earth receives 23% more solar radiation from the sun. Eccentricity usually spans about 100,000 years from being  partially circular to slightly elliptical, right now the Earth Eccentricity is slowly decreasing which means that the Earth’s orbit is becoming more circular.

		<h2>Obliquity</h2>
The angle of Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted as the Earth orbits around the sun and the tilt may become more or less curved, this is called Obliquity. Obliquity is the change of the rotation of the axis. Obliquity is extremely important because it is the reason why we have seasons on Earth, which are Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall / Autumn. Over the last millions of years, Earth’s axial tilt has ranged between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees to the orbital plane. The greater the axial tilt, the more extreme our seasons are because the Earth receives more solar radiation from the sun on each hemisphere as it is pointed towards the sun causing summers to have greater exposure to solar radiation while winters have less exposure to solar radiation when it is tilted away. Larger tilts favor glaciation periods which are periods in time where glaciers retreat. These changes are presented globally as higher latitude areas experience an increase in solar radiation than those that are closer to the equator. The Earth’s axis is currently 23.4 degrees so about halfway between its extremes and it is currently slowly decreasing that span about 41,000 years. About 10,000 years ago, the Earth’s axis was at its maximum tilt, while in the next 10,000 years, the axial tilt will be at its minimum. As Obliquity decreases, the seasons on Earth become more milder as winters become warmer, summers being colder which allows higher latitude areas with ice and snow to build up.

		<h2>Precession</h2>
While the Earth rotates, it wobbles slightly on its axis. This movement is caused by the tidal influences from the sun and the moon which create our tidal waves. This tidal influence causes Earth to bulge at the equator which affects its rotation, this is called axial precession. Axial Precession spans around 25,771.5 years and affects the Earth’s climate similar to Obliquity. It causes one hemisphere to have more extreme season variation while the other has less extreme season variation. Currently perihelion occurs during the winter in the northern hemisphere and during the summer in the southern hemisphere. This makes seasons in the southern hemisphere to have hotter summers as well as a moderation of summers in the northern hemisphere. But this contrast won’t last forever since in 13,000 years, these conditions will flip so the northern hemisphere will experience more solar radiation exposure (higher temperatures in the summers) with the southern hemisphere having moderate summers. Precession also affects Earth’s farthest and closest point to the sun as well as seasonal timing, however modern calendars tie themselves to the seasons, for example, the northern hemisphere's winter will never occur in July. Precession also affects Earth’s alignment with other celestial bodies, for example, today the Earth’s North Stars are Polaris and Polaris Aurelius but thousands of years ago, Earth’s North Stars were instead, Kochab and Pherkad.

There is also apsidal precession, the Earth not only wobbles on its rotational axis, it also wobbles during its orbital ellipse around the sun. That is why Earth has an over shaped orbit around the sun. Earth also wobbles irregularly, this is primarily due to its interactions with the two largest gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. The span of apsidal precession is about 112,000 years. Apsidal precession also changes the orientation of Earth’s orbit relative to its ecliptic plane.
