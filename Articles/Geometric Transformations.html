		<h1>Geometric Transformations</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Geometric transformations are changes to a two dimensional figure on a coordinate graph. Geometric transformations affect the size and rotation of a shape, not the shape of it. For example translation is when a 2D figure is moved…

		<h2>Translation</h2>
		Translation in geometry is when every point of a figure moves the same distance as the other…
		<img src="../Images/GeomTr.img3.png">
		In this example all the points of the 2D figure are translated 3 units to the right, or in other words the x values of all the figures are three more than the original. Translation doesn’t affect the size and shape of the figure, only the position of the entire figure is changed. Translation can be written as a figure being translated a certain amount of units up, down, left or right. If a figure is translated up, that means that all of its point’s y values have increased a certain amount. If a figure is translated down, instead of the y value being increased, it instead decreases all the y values a certain amount. If a figure is translated to the left, that means that all of its points x values have been decreased by a certain amount and the opposite is with a figure translated to the right. Sometimes the figure can be moved two different directions like up and to the right…

		<h2>Rotation</h2>
		Rotation in geometry is the circular motion that a 2D figure moves around its center of rotation…
		<img src="../Images/GeomTr.img5.png">
		Let's say that this figure is going to rotate 90&deg; clockwise. Depending on the angle that the 2D figure is going to be rotated by, the x and y values change…
		<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Angle of Rotation</th>
    <th>Formula</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>90&deg; clockwise and 270&deg; counterclockwise</td>
    <td>(x, y) → (y, -x)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>180&deg; clockwise and counterclockwise</td>
    <td>(x, y) → (-x, -y)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>270&deg; clockwise and 90&deg; counterclockwise</td>
    <td>(x, y) → (-y, x)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

		Depending on what angle the 2D figure is rotating to, the x and y values become different. Looking back on the example, the points are at, (-2, 2), (-3, 2), and (-3, 3). We can just convert the values and they become, (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)...

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		Reflection is when a 2D figure is mirrored across a line called the line of reflection…
		<img src="../Images/GeomTr.img7.png">
		The line of reflection could be any straight line but common examples are the y axis and the x axis. If a shape is reflected across the y axis, the x values of the mirrored shape are negative to the original. So a point at (5, 3) that is being reflected across the y axis, the mirrored point would be at (-5, 3). Reflection doesn’t affect the size or shape of the figure, only the position and direction is changed.

		<h2>Dilations</h2>
		Dilating a 2D figure is creating a clone of the original and changing the size of the copy but keeping all the proportions from the original…
		<img src="../Images/GeomTr.img8.png">
		Dilation affects the size of the shape but doesn’t change the shape and orientation of it. When a dilated figure gets created, it doesn’t stay in the same position as the original, rather it moves to align itself with the original.
