		<h1>Derivatives</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Derivatives are the unique and instantaneous change in a sloped line like a quadratic…

		When we put two dots on the line, both dots would be on a spot with a different slope...
		<img src="../Images/Deriv.img2.png">
		These points have different slopes because as the base of an exponent increases…
	<p> &sup2; = 1</p>
	<p>2&sup2; = 4  (+3)</p>
	<p>3&sup2;  = 9 (+5) </p>
	<p>4&sup2;  = 16 (+7)</p>
	<p>5&sup2;  = 25 (+9)</p>
For derivatives we take the slope function…
<p>Slope =  y / x = Change in y / Change in x</p>
x changes to  ∆x…
<p>Slope =  / ∆x</p>
y changes to f(x + x) - f(x)...
<p>Slope =  f(x +x) - f(x)x / x</p>


Let's say that the function is f(x) = 2x&sup2;. We would substitute the f with 2x&sup2;…
<p>Slope =  2(x +∆x)<sup>2</sup> - 2x&sup2; /  ∆x</p>
<p>= 2x&sup2; + 2x * 2x + (2x&sup2;) - 2x&sup2;  x</p>
<p>= 2x * 2x + (∆x&sup2;) x</p>
<p>= 2x * 2 + x</p>
<p>= 4x + x</p>
And as ∆x converges towards zero, we can just say that the derivative of 2x&sup2; is 4x.

<h2>Derivative Notation</h2>
Derivatives can be shown in many different ways. For example the most common one is d/dx…
<p>dy/dx 2x&sup2; </p>
This is telling us the rate of change of y over the rate of change of x. This is the Leibniz notation for derivatives.

Another way is adding an apostrophe next to the f in a function…
<p>f(x) = 3x</p>
<p>f’(x) = 3</p>
Derivatives can also be written with a capitalized letter as the function…
<p>h(x) = 6x<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>H(x) = 18x<sup>2</sup></p>
A function with an apostrophe is called prime notation. 

Derivatives can also be written with a limit as well…
<p>f’(x) = lim c --> 0 f(x + c) - f(x) /  c</p>
In this type of derivative notation, c is the rate of change of x.

Derivatives can be shown with a capital D for derivatives surrounding f(x)...
<p>D(f(x)</p>
<p>Df(x) </p>
<p>Df (x) </p>
This is called Euler’s notation.
