		<h1>Mean, Median and Mode</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Mean (also called arithmetic mean), Median and Mode are all specific values in a set of numbers. And they are used frequently, more than you think. These three measurements are going to be covered with their formulas. All are also called measures of central tendency, meaning that they represent all the summarization of all the data and identify the central point of it.

<h2>Median</h2> 
The Median is the middle number in a set full of numbers. It is described to be a middle number that separates the lower half of the numbers and the upper half of the numbers. For example, let's say we had a set with a bunch of random numbers…
<p>1, 2, 5, 7, 10</p>
Since the number 5 is the middle value of all the other numbers surrounding it, it is the median. Now sometimes the Median can be a lot more concealed than just looking in the middle, in fact medians can be decimal numbers. For example, take a look at this number set…
<p>12, 20, 25, 30, 42, 64, 91, 108</p>
Notice how this set has an even amount of numbers unlike the previous example. This is where two different formulas are differentiated based on if the amount of numbers are odd or even. For sets with an odd amount of numbers, we would count the amount of numbers in the set. In the previous example, there are five numbers, we would add one then divide by 2. And that gives us 3, which means that the 3rd number is the median. But this set has 8 numbers which is an even amount. When you are trying to find the median for a number set that has an even amount of numbers in it, you take the two numbers in the middle of the set and add them together so in this example, we add 30 + 42.
<p>12, 20, 25, 30, 42, 64, 91, 108</p>
<p>30 + 42 = 72</p>
After you add the two numbers together, you divide the number by 2.
<p>72 / 2 = 36</p>
After dividing the number by 2. That number is the median, in this case, 36 is the median. 


<h2>Mean</h2>
The Mean is a little more complicated than figuring out the median, and can result more commonly in decimals. The Mean is the average of every number in a set. Let's say we had a number set like this…
<p>2, 3, 7, 12, 18, 24</p>
Instead of finding the number in the middle of the set, we would instead find the average. First we would have to add up all the values so…
<p>2 + 3 = 5</p>
<p>5 + 7 = 12</p>
<p>12 + 12 = 24</p>
<p>24 + 18 = 42</p>
<p>42 + 24 = 66</p>
After finding the sum of all the numbers in the set, we would have to divide the final number by the amount of numbers in the set, in this example there are six sets…
<p>66/6</p>
And 66 is divisible by 6 which equals 11 so our mean or average is 11. Unlike the median of a set of numbers, the Mean isn’t dependent on if the amount of numbers in the set is even or not. Also, averages can be decimal numbers, which can make calculating them much more complicated than calculating the median…

<h2>Mode</h2>
The Mode is the most common number on a set of numbers. In other words, the number that appears the most is the mode. Let's say we had a set of numbers…
<p>1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7</p>
We can see that duplicates make up the majority of the set. But the mode is the number that appears the most amount of times. In which 3 is the mode of the set. 

There can also be multiple modes in a set like this one…
<p>1, 2, 4, 6, 6, 8, 10, 10, 12</p>
In this set, 6 and 10 both appear twice as every other number only appears once. This means that there are two modes in this set which are 6 and 10.
