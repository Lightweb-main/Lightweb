		<h1>Antiderivatives</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Antiderivatives (also called, reverse derivatives, primitive integrals, and primitive functions) are calculus equations that are the complete opposite of derivatives hence the name.<br></br>
		There are differences and similarities between antiderivatives and derivatives. First antiderivatives come from integrals which have integral signs whereas derivatives come from d/dx notation…
		<br><br>
		<p>Antiderivatives</p>
		<p>∫3x dx</p>
		<p>Derivatives<p>
		<p>d/dx 3x</p>

		Also the antiderivatives have a constant added…
		<p>Antiderivatives<br>
		<p>∫3x dx</p>
		<p>3x<sup>2</sup>/2  = 1.5x<sup>2</sup> + C</p>
		<p>Derivatives</p>
		<p>d/dx 3x<sup>2</sup> = <br><br>f’(x) = 6</p>

		<h2>Solving Antiderivatives</h2>
		To find antiderivatives, you simply do the opposite for derivatives. For example the power rule turns from this…<br>
		<p>d/dx = nx<sup>n - 1</sup></p><br>
		To this…<br>
		<p>∫x dx = x<sup>n + 1</sup> / n + 1</p><br>
		For example…<br>
		<p>∫3x<sup>4</sup> dx</p> <br>
		First we add one to the exponent…<br>
		<p>3x<sup><b>4 + 1</b></sup></p>
		<p>3x<sup><b>5</b></sup></p>
		Then we divide by the new exponent…<br>
		<p>3x<sup>5</sup><b>/ 5</b></p>
		The antiderivative of 3x<sup>4</sup> is 3x<sup>5</sup> / 5. 
		
		<h2>Antiderivatives vs Integrals</h2>
		Antiderivatives are also associated with indefinite integrals as they are pretty much the same except antiderivatives include +C because C represents the constant of integration...
		<p>Indefinite Integral: <br>∫3x<sup>4 </sup>dx</p>
		<p>Antiderivatives: <br>3x<sup>5</sup> / 5 + C</p>

		<h2>Antiderivative Notation</h2>
		Antiderivatives are shown in numerous ways. Antiderivatives are shown as a capital F…<br>
		<p>f(x) = 3x<sup>5</sup></p>
		<p>F(x) = 1/2x<sup>6</sup></p>
