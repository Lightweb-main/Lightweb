	<h1>Inverse Functions</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Inverse functions are functions that reverse or do the opposite things as their normal or regular function counterparts. For example, the conversion from celsius to fahrenheit is...
	<p>f(x) = (9/5 * x) + 32</p>
	This is the formula used to convert celsius temperatures into fahrenheit temperatures, however if we do the opposite and convert fahrenheit temperatures to celsius, then the formula would be...
	<p>c(x) = (x - 32) * 5/9</p>
	Notice how every operation on x is reversed, the +32 turned into -32 and 9/5 turned into 5/9.
	<h2>Inverse Function Notation</h2>
	Inverse functions are shown as the regular function but instead with a -1 as the exponent and the input (x) value being the output (y)...
	<p>f<sup>-1</sup>(y) = f(x)</p>
	This is similar to whole numbers with negative exponents...
	<p>2<sup>-1</sup> = 1/2<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p>f(x) = 3x - 2</p>
	<p>f<sup>-1</sup>(y) = (x + 2) / 3</p>
	<h2>Finding Inverse Functions</h2>
	To find inverse functions, reverse every operation in the function, so for example addition becomes subtraction, multiplication becomes division, and paratheses are split...
	<p>f(x) = &radic;x</p>
	<p>f<sup>-1</sup>(y) = x<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>g(x) = 7x<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>g<sup>-1</sup>(y) = (&radic;x / 7), -(&radic;x / 7)</p>
