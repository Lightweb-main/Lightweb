		<h1>Parabolas</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		A <b>parabola</b> is a shape commonly found within graphing quadratics and is shaped as a U-shaped curve...
		<img src="../Images/Parabolas.img1.png">
		A parabolas direction and shape can change vastly depending on the slope of the quadratic that forms it...

		<h2>General Parabola Formula</h2>
		The general formulas for parabolas are usually expressed in <b>vertex form</b> which is...
		<p>Vertical Parabolas</p>
		<p>y = (x - h)<sup>2</sup> + k</p>
		<p>Horizontal Parabolas</p>
		<p>x = (y - h)<sup>2</sup> + k</p>
		The general formula for a parabola changes depending on the direction of where it's going and where the vertex is...

		As you can see, the formula of a parabola changes depending on its direction and its vertex coordinates.
		<h2>Structure of a Parabola</h2>
		A parabola is made out of many different points and lines that are crucial to actually graphing it.
		<h3>Vertex</h3>
		The vertex of a parabola is the highest/lowest point of it. Now the vertex being the lowest or highest point depends on which direction the parabola opens from...
