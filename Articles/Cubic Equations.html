	<h1>Cubic Equations</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Cubic equations are polynomials that have one variable cubed (usually with a coefficient)...
 	<p>ax&sup3; + bx&sup2; + cx + d = 0</p>
	Similar to quadratics, a cannot equal zero in cubics…
	<p>2x&sup2; + 3x - 4 = 0</p>
	Since this function doesn’t have a variable with a power of 3 or in other words a = 0. This isn’t a cubic but rather a quadratic.
	There are many ways to solve a cubic equation, but it depends on what the cubic equation is.

	Factoring Back to Quadratics
	Sometimes factoring a cubic is possible when d = 0…
	<p>3x&sup3; - 4x&sup2; + 3x = 0</p>
	This cubic equation doesn’t have a fixed d value which means that one of the roots for this cubic is zero…
	<p>X = 0</p>
	We can also factor the cubic back to a quadratic…
	<p>x(3x&sup2; - 4x + 3)</p>
	Now we can solve for the other two roots by solving the quadratic in the parenthesis…
	<p>3x&sup2; - 4x + 3 = 0</p>
	<p>4 &plusmn; &radic; (16 - 24) / 6</p>
	The final roots are 0, (4 + &radic; -8) / 6, and (4 - &radic; -8) / 6</p>
