		<h1>The Rock Cycle</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The rock cycle is the continuous recycling of rocks on Earth. The Rock cycle is considered to be the longest and slowest cycle present on Earth. The rock cycle mainly centers around the three types of rocks, Igneous Sedimentary, and Metamorphic. These three types of rocks can form in different conditions. 

<h2>Igneous Rocks</h2>
Igneous Rocks are rocks that are formed from the rapid cooling of magma, usually taking place under a volcano. Obsidian is a great example of an igneous rock, since volcanic eruptions release large amounts of lava, the lava afterwards cools down and forms obsidian. Igneous rocks can also go under the process of crystallization where the longer it takes for the magma to cool, the more crystals are formed within the rocks. Igneous rocks have two different types of rocks. 

Extrusive Igneous Rocks are rocks that formed from the cooling of lava and are found on the surface of the Earth or higher up like near a recent volcanic eruption. Extrusive igneous rocks usually cool very quickly due to being on the Earth's surface which usually form smaller crystals.

Intrusive Igneous Rocks are rocks that are also formed from the cooling of lava but instead of being found on the surface or higher, they are found underground. Intrusive Igneous rocks usually cool slowly underground which usually results in larger crystals.

<h2>Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
Sedimentary rocks are rocks that are formed from sediments, which are tiny pieces of rocks, soil, and sand which were eroded to a specific location. Sedimentary rocks are just amalgamations of sediments. Erosion is the process of being broken down by natural elements like wind, animals, water, or ice. When rocks are eroded, they form sediments. Soon these sediments are deposited which means that they are carried somewhere else far from when they were broken down from the original rock. Soon these sediments start building up which create sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually have a pattern to them like multiple lines going across them. Sandstone and Limestone are both examples of sedimentary rocks.

<h2>Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
Metamorphic rocks are rocks that are formed when undergoing extreme heat and pressure which usually takes place deep within the earth. Gneiss and marble are both examples of metamorphic rocks. Metamorphic rocks always start out as another type of rock but then due to exposure to extreme heat and pressure, the result are metamorphic rocks. Sometimes metamorphic rocks eventually turn into magma which then turns into Igneous rocks. The process of metamorphism isnâ€™t melting the rock down into magma, but instead turning the rock into more compact and denser rocks. 

<h2>Igneous Processes</h2>
Igneous rocks first have to become magma which is called melting. Then they would have to cool down to become Igneous rocks. These types of rocks can break down and become sedimentary rocks or be exposed to even more heat and pressure to become metamorphic rocks.

<h2>Sedimentary Processes</h2>
Sedimentary rocks are formed when other types of rocks break down into smaller rocks called sediments, this process is called erosion and happens all the time. These sediments are carried away to another place which is called deposition, the place that they end up may be many miles away from the original location. When sediments stack on top of each other, cementation takes place where the sediments eventually stick together to form sedimentary rocks.

<h2>Metamorphic Processes</h2>
Metamorphic rocks are formed when other types of rocks are exposed to extreme heat and pressure (usually deep within the Earth). Metamorphic rocks can melt down into magma and become igneous rocks once cooled down or become sedimentary rocks when they are eroded down into sediments.
