		<h1>Secure. Contain. Protect</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Secure. Contain. Product or commonly abbreviated as the SCP Foundation is a fictitious, top secret organization that contains anomalous entities and objects. These anomalies called SCPs are ordered in numerical order so like SCP 001, SCP 002, 003 and so on. The SCP foundation's main goal is to contain anomalous entities that endanger public societies. And only a handful of these SCPs have enough power to cause world ending events. SCPs are often classified into multiple groups, the most common being Safe, Euclid, and Keter. This depends on the difficulty of containment.
		<h2>Containment Classes</h2>
		<h3>Primary Classes</h3>
		These are object classes that are commonly and primarily used by the SCP foundation.
		<h4>Safe</h4>
		SCPs that have the containment class, "Safe" are easily contained. This can be because the SCP foundation has a good understanding of the anomaly, the anomaly itself doesn't possess sentience, or little materials are needed for containment.
		<h4>Euclid</h4>
		SCPs that have the containment class, "Euclid" are not easily contained or take up a great amount of resources for full containment. This containment class is the most common as many reasons can be because the anomaly is autonomous or possess sentience/sapience, the foundation doesn't have a good understanding of the SCP, or containment is considered to not always be reliable.
		<h4>Keter</h4>
		SCPs that have the containment class, "Keter", are very hard to almost impossible to contain. This can be because of very extensive containment, anomalous properties like teleportation (SCP 106), the SCP foundation not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or either lacking the technology to counter and or contain said anomaly. These SCPs are often sapient or have powers that can allow them to easily escape containment, take SCP 106 for example who can teleport into their own realm and pass through walls.
		<h4>Thaumiel</h4>
		Thaumiel class SCPs are used by the foundation to contain other SCPs. Thaumiel class SCPs are often classified at the highest levels of the foundations as the O5 Council and a few other members outside of it only have knowledge on these SCPs.
		<h3>Secondary Classes</h3>
		These classes aren't as commonly used as primary classes but are still used for special containment protocols.
		<h4>Apollyon</h4>
		Apollyon class SCPs are impossible to contain and are known to breach containment easily. Usually these SCPs are known to trigger K-Class Scenarios or world ending events. The best exmaple of an Apollyon SCP is SCP 001, "When Day Breaks". When this SCP activates, all humans will turn into goo. These SCPs are known to the SCP foundation but it cannot do anything against it.
		<h4>Archon</h4>
		Archon class SCPs are anomalies that could be contained but are best not to. Note that these SCPs aren't uncontainable, they are just left uncontained.
		<h4>Ticonderoga</h4>
		Ticonderoga SCPs are anomalies that cannot be contained and are not contained, basically a combination of Apollyon and Archon. These SCPs can be widespread over the Earth which the SCP foundation cannot contain without the publics gaining awareness of the SCP foundation. Ticonderoga SCPs can also include those who are known by the SCP foundation but the distance is too great to do anything.
		<h3>Non-Standard Object Classes</h3>
		These object classes are used for former SCPs that have been neutralized, are no longer anamonlous, or currently doesn't have a class yet.
		<h4>Explained</h4>
		Explained SCPs were former SCPs until they were fully understood by the foundation and can be explained through public science and logic. 
		<h4>Neutralized</h4>
		Neutralized SCPs were SCPs until they were not anomalous anyone either through accidentally or intentional destruction or disabling.
		<h4>Decommissioned</h4>
		Decommissioned SCPs are former SCPs that have been intentially destroyed or their anomalous properties have been neutralized by the SCP foundation. This can happen because the SCP consumes too many resources, the SCP isn't fully contained, or extreme suffering or excessive loss of life can happen.
		<h4>Pending</h4>
		Pending SCPs are anomalies that don't currently have an object class as more information is needed to propertly assign one.
