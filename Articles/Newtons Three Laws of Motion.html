		<h1>Newton's Three Laws of Motion</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Sir Issac Newton is the English Physicist and mathematician who is most famous for discovering gravity through an apple falling from a tree hitting his head. Newton also is known for his three laws of motion which are fundemental to physics itself.
		<h2>Newton's First Law (Inertia)</h2>
		Newton's first law of motion is the Law of inertia in which an object will remain moving at a constant velocity unless acted by another opposing force while objects at rest (not moving) will stay at rest. This idea is called inertia which is the natural tendency for objects to continue to move when acted upon a force and will only stop due to friction or another opposing force. For example, in a soccer match, a player attempts to shoot a goal and the goalie stops the ball...

		If the goalkeeper didn't block the ball, the ball would travel further and eventually will be caught by the net. <br><br><br>
		But on Earth, theres one force that slows down an object moving gradually, it's <b>friction</b>. Friction is the force that acts against the force that is acted by an object or a person. So looking at this example, if the net wasn't there, the ball would continue to get slower and slower until it stops.
		<h2>Newton's Second Law (Acceleration)</h2>
		Newton's second law deals with <b>acceleration</b>, which is a change in velocity. Newton's second law also come with probably the most fundemental equation in all of physics and enginnering...
		<p>F = ma</p>
		In this equation, "F" is force, "m" is mass, and "a" is acceleration. This formula can be used to find out that <b>the more mass the object has, the more force that has to be acted on to get the accerlation equal to what it would be if it was lighter.</b>So for example, lets say a 2D box is about 45 kg (kilograms) and the amount of force acted on it is about 180 N (newtons)...

		To calculate the acceleration since the force and the mass of the box is known, we must take the formula, F = ma, and seperate the a on the right side of the formula to isolate it...

		 Then we just plug in the values...

		</math>
		The acceleration of the box is 4 meters per second sqaured. Of course, with the mass increasing so does the amount of force required to meet the exact acceleration increases too...
		<img src="../Images/NewtonLaws.img3.png">
		To find the force, just multiply the mass of the box times acceleration...
		<p>F = ma</p>
		<p>F = 200 kg * 4 m/s<sup>2</sup></p>
		<p>F = 800 N</p>
		The force needed to push a 200 kg box to go 4 meters per second sqaured is 800 Newtons.
		<h2>Newton's Third law (Action and Reaction)</h2>
		Newton's third law is about how every force has an equal and an opposite version of itself. For example, for the boxes, if someone pushes the box with 50 newtons and the box is 100 kg, then the box will exert 50 newtons back onto the person who's pushing the box...
