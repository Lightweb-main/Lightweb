		<h1>Rational and Irrational Numbers</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Numbers in mathematics are categorized into a lot of terms. One of those are rational and irrational numbers. Every number is either rational or irrational depending on its value. 

		<h2>Rational Numbers</h2>
Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction. Integers are a common example of rational numbers. Some decimals like 0.33, 0.5, and 0.75 are all rational numbers despite being decimals. Rational numbers are represented by p over q, while q cannot be 0…
<p>p / q</p>
  <p>q ≠ 0</p>
Not every number is rational, some cannot be expressed as a fraction, those numbers are irrational numbers.

		<h2>Irrational Numbers</h2>
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction. Mathematical constants like pi and euler are both irrational numbers…
<p>𝝅, e - Irrational</p>
Other examples of irrational numbers are square root of numbers that never terminates nor repeats, products, quotients, and fractions that include irrational numbers are also considered irrational…
<p>𝝅 / 2, &radic;𝝅, 3𝝅, 𝝅<sup>2</sup></p>
