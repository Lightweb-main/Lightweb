	<h1>Composite Functions</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Composite Functions in mathematics are essentially just a function inside another function, there isn't a simpler way to put it. For example, lets make two functions, f(x) and g(x)...
    <p>f(x)  g(x)</p>
  And then give them their formulas...
    <p>f(x) = 2x + 3</p>
    <p>g(x) = x - 5</p>
  And finally lets define an h(x) function...
    <p>h(x)</p>
  So in this example, h(x) is a <b>composite function</b>, where g(x) is inside of f(x)...
	<p>h(x) = f(g(x))</p>
  So h(x) is the <b>composite function</b>, f(x) as the outer function, and g(x) as the inner function. <br><br>
g(x) is essentially the x part in f(x) since it replaces x in f(x)...
	<p>f(g(x)) ---> x = g(x)</p> 
  <h2>Evaluating Composite Functions</h2>
  Evaluating composite function is finding the output of it. For example, lets give f(x) and g(x) equations...
<p>f(x) = 2x - 3</p>
<p>g(x) = 3x + 1</p>
And lets input 5 in g(x)...
<p>g(5) = 3x + 1</p>
Lets evaluate g(5)...
<p>g(5) = 3(5) + 1</p>
<p>g(5) = 15 + 1</p>
<p>g(5) = 16</p>
So g(5) equals 16, now lets input that into f(x)...
<p>f(16) = 2x - 3</p>
<p>f(16) = 2(16) - 3</p>
<p>f(16) = 32 - 3</p>
<p>f(16) = 29</p>
So finally f(g(5)) equals 29...
<p>f(g(5)) = 29 --> g(5) = 16</p>
<h2>Finding composite functions</h2>
To find a composite function, substitute x in the outer function with g(x), the inner function. For example...
<p>f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x</p>
<p>g(x) = 4x + 4</p>
<p>Whats f(g(4))?</p>
Lets substitute the x in f(x) with 4x + 4...
<p>f(4x + 4) = 2(4x + 4)<sup>2</sup> + 3(4x + 4)</p>
<p>f(4x + 4) = 2(16x<sup>2</sup> + 32x + 16) + 12x + 12</p>
<p>f(4x + 4) = 32x<sup>2</sup> + 64x + 32 + 12x + 12</p>
<p>f(4x + 4) = 32x<sup>2</sup> + 76x + 44 </p>
So the composite function of g(x) and f(x) is 32x<sup>2</sup> + 76x + 44.
<h2>Commutative Property doesn't apply</h2>
The commutative property in multiplication where the order of multiplication results in the same answer does not apply to composite functions, changing the order of composing will result in a different answer...
	<p>f(x) = 2x - 1</p>
	<p>g(x) = x<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>What's f(g(3))</p>
	<p>g(3) = 3<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>g(3) = 9</p>
	<p>f(9) = 18 - 1</p>
	<p>f(9) = 17</p>
	<p>What's g(f(3))</p>
	<p>f(3) = 6 - 1</p>
	<p>f(3) = 5</p>
	<p>g(5) = 5<sup>2</sup></p>
	<p>g(5) = 25</p>
	Notice how flipping the outer function with the inner function results in a different answer. 
<h2>Notation of Composing Functions</h2>
Composing functions can be shown through a few ways, like through having the inner function inside the parantheses of the outer function...
	<p>f(g(x))</p>
This means that g is composed in f.<br><br>
They can also appear with the two function letters being multiplied together...
	<p>(f * g)(x)</p>
The order of multiplication is very important as the second letter is the function that is composed by the other function...
	<p>(f * g)(x) = f(g(x))</p>
	<p>(g * f)(x) = g(f(x))</p>
The inner function can also be enclosed in sqaure brackets...
	<p>f[g(x)]</p>
This is to show that the x in f(x) is being substituted by g(x).
