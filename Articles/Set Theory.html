		<h1>Set Theory</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Set theory is a branch in mathematics that goes over groups of numbers…
<p>{1, 2, 3, 4}</p>
The example shown above is a <b>set</b>. A set is a collection of data like numbers in this example (but just know that sets can contain letters, other characters, even other sets). The individual numbers are called <b>elements</b> or <b>distinct objects</b>.

<h2>Different Types of Sets</h2>
In mathematics, there are a few types of sets. 

A <b>finite set</b> is known as a group with a limited amount of numbers…
<p>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}</p>
An <b>infinite set</b> is known as a group with an unlimited amount of numbers, the most common example being a group with all natural numbers…
<p>{1, 2, 3…}</p>
The three dots show that the set continues with every number being 1 more than the last. 

An <b>empty set</b> is a set with no elements/objects…
<p>{} = ∅</p>
An empty set is either shown with a pair of curly brackets with no elements inside or the letter O crossed out with a single line.

A subset is essentially a set in a set and is shown with a stretched out c…
<p>X ⊂ Y</p>

This is basically, “All of X’s elements are also in Y”. A subset is a set of elements in a set…
<p>A = {a, b, c… z}</p>
<p>B = {a, e, i, o, u}</p>
In this example, A is the superset in this example or the set that the subset has some elements of…
<p>A ⊃ B</p>

Here are other examples of subset/superset relationships…
<p>X ⊄ Y </p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is not a subset to Y</p>
<p>X ⊆ Y</p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is a subset and has every element in Y</p>
<p>X ⊈ Y</p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is not a subset nor equal to Y</p>
<p>X ⊂ Y</p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is a subset of Y but doesn’t have every element in Y</p>
<p>X ⊃ Y</p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is a superset of Y (has every element Y and has more)</p>
<p>X ⊇ Y</p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is a superset of Y (has every element Y and or has more)</p>
<p>X ⊅ Y</p>
<p style='font-size: 16px'>X is not a superset of Y</p>

<h2>Set Operations</h2>
In set theory, there are operations or equations that can describe the relationship(s) between two sets.

The union of two sets are the elements that are found in either A or B (can be both). The symbol for union is almost identical to a capital U...
<p>A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
<p>B = {a, b, c, d, e}</p>
<p>A ∪ B = {1, a, 2, b, 3, c, 4, d, 5, e}</p>
The union of two sets does not show duplicates or numbers that appear multiple times.

The intersection of two sets are the elements that appear in both sets. The symbol for the intersection of two sets is an upside-down U…
<p>A = {2, 3, 4}</p>
<p>B = {1, 2, 3, 5}</p>
<p>A ∩ B = {2, 3}</p>
Just like union, intersection doesn’t show duplicate numbers or numbers that appear several times.

The difference between the two sets are the elements that are in A but aren’t in B. The symbol for difference is the minus sign…
<p>A = {10, 20, 30, 40}</p>
<p>B = {10, 30, 40}</p>
<p>A - B = {20}	</p>
The complement of a set are all the elements that are not in one set (A) but are in a universal set (U). In other words the complement of a set is all the elements that are not in the set. The complement of a set is shown as a superscript C (Ac) or with an apostrophe…
<p>U = {All alphabets}</p>
<p>A = {a, b, c}</p>
<p>AC = {d, e, f, g… z}</p>
<h2>Cardinality</h2>
Cardinality refers to the amount of elements a set has, for example…
<p>{a, e, i, o, u}</p>
Since there are five elements, the cardinal number of this set is 5. Cardinality is shown with two lines both on the ends of the set…
<p>{a, e, i, o, u} = 5</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>
An element is a number, letter or character that is in a set. Variables can be elements in sets, to understand the relationship with variables and elements, we must look at the different sets used.

There is a set of all the natural numbers which are all non-negative, not complex numbers…
<p>N = {1, 2, 3… }</p>
This set is denoted as, “ℕ” which contains all natural numbers…
<p>ℕ = {1, 2, 3… }</p>   
There’s also a notation for Integers, it's similar to natural numbers…
<p>ℤ = {-, -3, -2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3… }</p>
For rational numbers…
<p>ℚ = {All rational numbers}</p>
For real numbers…
<p>ℝ = {All rational numbers}</p>
For all imaginary numbers…
<p>Ι = {-i, -3i, -2i, -1i, 1i, 2i, 3i}</p>
For all complex numbers…
<p>ℂ = {All complex numbers}</p>
For all algebraic numbers…
<p>A = {All algebraic numbers}</p>
All of these sets are used to tell if a variable or number is either one of these types of numbers.

If a variable is in a set, it is shown with a stretched out e…
<p>X ∈ ℕ</p>
This shows us that X is an element of natural numbers  or in other words, X is a natural number.

This can also apply to distinct objects in a set…
<p>1 ∈ {1, 11, 21, 31, 41}</p>
<h2>Set Builder Form</h2>
Set builder form is a way that sets are written…
<p>{x | x > 1}</p>
This in semantic (word) form is, “Every value of x, such that is greater than 1”, or in other words, every value of x that is greater than 1. Here's another example…
<p>{x ∈ Z : 3x > 6}</p>
The set contains every integer that is greater than 2. The vertical line and the colon represent, “Such that” which are the values of x that meet the condition which usually is an inequality.
