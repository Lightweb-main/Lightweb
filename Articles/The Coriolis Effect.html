		<h1>The Coriolis Effect</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Coriolis Effect (also referred to as Coriolis Force as a singular word) is the theory that involves an imaginary force, blowing wind in different directions based on what hemisphere the wind is in. Since the Earth rotates which creates our days which are 24 hours, wind doesn’t go in one direction, instead it gets redirected, when wind is in the northern hemisphere, it gets deflected to the right while wind in the southern hemisphere gets deflected to the left. The Coriolis Effect is responsible for some of the greatest impacts of the Earth’s climate. Its origins lie within Earth’s rotation. 

<h2>Cause</h2>
Due to Earth spinning around constantly, wind doesn’t just travel in a straight line. Earth’s rotation makes winds instead travel in a curved line. If the Earth wasn’t rotating and was still, wind would be traveling from the poles to the equator. The Coriolis Effect causes wind to be redirected to the right or left depending on which hemisphere it is in, winds that are in the northern hemisphere are blown to the right while winds in the southern hemisphere are blown to the left. This redirection in winds is what is known as the Coriolis Effect. Another major cause of the Coriolis effect is that different parts of the Earth move at different speeds, let’s say that you are at the north or south pole, now draw a circle around one of the poles. Now imagine that you are at the equator on a hypothetical remote island, again, draw a circle around the Equator. You would notice that the remote island at the equator moves much faster because the circle around the Equator has a bigger circumference than the circle at one of the poles.
Landmasses closer to the equator move faster than land masses that are farther away from the equator. Now another example. Let's say that there was an identical clone of you and you and them are facing each other but you are closer to the equator and they are on the same hemisphere as you are. It would appear to them as you were floating away from them, but the direction is dependent on which hemisphere you are in. If you were in the northern hemisphere, you would appear to them that you are floating to the right, if you were in the southern hemisphere, you would appear to them that you are floating away to the left. 

<h2>Effects</h2>
The Coriolis effect impacts Earth’s climate significantly. For example, Hurricanes on Earth are fueled by air since they are low pressure systems, meaning that they suck air from their environment. The Coriolis Effect causes hurricanes to rotate counterclockwise or clockwise depending on what hemisphere they are in.
