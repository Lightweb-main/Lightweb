	<h1>All Forms of Quadratic Functions</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	This is a quadratic...
	<p>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 2 = 0</p>
	A quadratic is an equation in which the highest power is 2, a quadratic on a graph shows the shape of a <b>parabola</b> or like an unclosed oval...

	A quadratic, much like a linear equation can be expressed in many different forms, the most common being standard form which is the typical...
	<p>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
	This is the form that quadratics are typically written in, like these ones...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 6 = 0</p>
	<p>-x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 1 = 0</p>
	<p>5x<sup>2</sup> + x + 2 = 0</p>
	<p>2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 4 = 0</p>
	Standard form is particularly useful in finding the <b>roots</b> (the solutions) of a quadratic and the <b>y-intercept</b> (what y equals when x = 0), these can be found using either factoring...
	<p>x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 4 = 0</p><br>
	<p>Since 4 + (-1) = 3 and 4 * -1 = -4</p>
	<p>(x + 4)(x - 1) = 0</p>
	<p>x + 4 = 0 and x - 1 = 0</p>
	<p>x = -4 and x = 1</p>
	<p>x = -4, 1</p>
	Or through, the quadratic formula...

	These two methods can be used to find the roots of a quadratic, so find the y-intercept of a quadratic, you subsitute 0 as x and change the zero on the right to a y...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 3 = 0</p>
	<p>3(0)<sup>2</sup> - 2(0) + 3 = y</p>
	<p>3 = y</p>
	So the y-intercept of this quadratic is 3.
	<h2>Factored Form</h2>
	The factored form of a quadratic shows the constant, "a", together with the two linear expressions that multiply with a that form the quadratic...
	<p>f(x) = a(x - r<sub>1</sub>)(x - r<sub>2</sub>)</p>
	r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> are the roots of the quadratic.
