	<h1>All Forms of Quadratic Functions</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	This is a quadratic...
	<p>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 2 = 0</p>
	A quadratic is an equation in which the highest power is 2, a quadratic on a graph shows the shape of a <b>parabola</b> or like an unclosed oval...
	<img src="../Images/FormsofQuadFunc.img1.png">
	A quadratic, much like a linear equation can be expressed in many different forms, the most common being standard form which is the typical...
	<p>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
	This is the form that quadratics are typically written in, like these ones...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 6 = 0</p>
	<p>-x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 1 = 0</p>
	<p>5x<sup>2</sup> + x + 2 = 0</p>
	<p>2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 4 = 0</p>
	Standard form is particularly useful in finding the <b>roots</b> (the solutions) of a quadratic and the <b>y-intercept</b> (what y equals when x = 0), these can be found using either factoring...
	<p>x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 4 = 0</p><br>
	<p>Since 4 + (-1) = 3 and 4 * -1 = -4</p>
	<p>(x + 4)(x - 1) = 0</p>
	<p>x + 4 = 0 and x - 1 = 0</p>
	<p>x = -4 and x = 1</p>
	<p>x = -4, 1</p>
	Or through, the quadratic formula...

	These two methods can be used to find the roots of a quadratic, so find the y-intercept of a quadratic, you subsitute 0 as x and change the zero on the right to a y...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 3 = 0</p>
	<p>3(0)<sup>2</sup> - 2(0) + 3 = y</p>
	<p>3 = y</p>
	So the y-intercept of this quadratic is 3.
	<h2>Factored Form</h2>
	The factored form of a quadratic shows the constant, "a", together with the two linear expressions that multiply with a that form the quadratic...
	<p>f(x) = a(x - r<sub>1</sub>)(x - r<sub>2</sub>)</p>
	r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> are the roots of the quadratic. This form of quadratics is useful because you can easily tell what the roots of the quadratic are. For example...
	<p>x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 6 = 0</p>
	This quadratic unlike some others can be evenly factored. First we would have to find two numbers that add to "5" and multiply to equal "6", to do this, we can write every <b>factor pair</b> (two numbers that can multiply up to a certain numbers, called <b>factors</b>) of 6...
	<p>(1, 6)</p>
	<p>(-1, -6)</p>
	<p>(2, 3)</p>
	<p>(-2, -3)</p>
	Now we need to find the factor pair that the sum of the two numbers equals 5...
	<p>(1 + 6) = 7 &ne; 5</p>
	<p>(-1 - 6) = -7 &ne; -7</p>
	<p>(2 + 3) = 5 = 5</p>
	<p>(-2 + -3) = -5 &ne; 5</p>
	Since the factor pair, (2, 3) equals 5, that means that we can use those numbers to split up the coefficent of bx in the original quadratic like this...
	<p>x<sup>2</sup> + <b>5</b>x + 6 = 0</p>
	<p>x<sup>2</sup> + <b>(2 + 3)</b>x + 6 = 0</p>
	<p>x<sup>2</sup> + <b>2x + 3x</b> + 6 = 0</p>
	Now that we've split b in the quadratic, we now seperate the two terms...
	<p>(x<sup>2</sup> + 2x) + (3x + 6) = 0</p>
	Now that the quadratic is split into two, we can now factor the two seperate terms seperately...
	<p>x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0</p>
	Lastly, we factor out (x + 2) since both terms contain it...
	<p><b>x</b>(x + 2) + <b>3</b>(x + 2) = 0</p>
	<p>(x + 3)(x + 2) = 0</p>
	Now we've got our answer, x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 6 = 0 in factored form is (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0.<br><br><br>
	We can now find the roots of this quadratic through the Zero Product Property which states...
	<p>If a or b = 0, ab = 0</p>
	With this property, this automatically makes it...
	<p>x + 3 = 0 and x + 2 = 0</p>
	Now, we just solve the linear equations to get the roots...
	<p>x + 3 = 0<br><br>x + 2 = 0</p><br><br>
	<p>x = -3<br><br>x = -2</p>
	<p>x = -3, -2</p>
	And so the roots of this quadratic is -3 and -2.
	<h3>If a &ne; 1</h3>
	But if a &ne; 1, we would have to do an additional step at the beginning. For example...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> + 9x + 6 = 0</p>
	First we can see that all the terms are divisible by 3, which is what a equals, so we can factor 3 out of the quadratic...
	<p>3(x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 2) = 0</p>
	Then we factor the quadratic inside the parantheses...
	<p>3(x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 2) = 0</p>
	<p>3(x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 2) = 0</p>
	<p>Factors of 2:</p>
	<p>(1, 2)</p>
	<p>(-1, -2)</p>
	<p>(2, 1)</p>
	<p>(-2, -1)</p><br><br>
	<p>1 + 2 = 3 = 3</p>
	<p>-1 - 2 = -3 &ne; 3</p>
	<p>2 + 1 = 3 = 3</p>
	<p>-2 - 1 = -3 &ne; 3</p>
	<p>3(x<sup>2</sup> + x + 2x + 2) = 0</p>
	<p>3((x<sup>2</sup> + x) + (2x + 2)) = 0</p>
	<p>3(x(x + 1) + 2(x + 1)) = 0</p>
	<p>3(x + 2)(x + 1) = 0</p>
	And so, x<sup>2</sup> + 9x + 6 is 3(x + 2)(x + 1).
	<h3>If a % b &ne; = 0 and a % c &ne; = 0</h3>
	But for a quadratic which cannot be factored by a constant like the previous example has an alternate way of figuring out the factored form of it...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - x - 10 = 0</p>
	We cannot divide 1 by 3 or 10 by 3 as they turn into fractions and it would be much harder finding the factors of a fraction than an integer. So instead we'll multiply the coefficent of ax (a) and cx (c) together to get our number of which we can find which factor pair equals b (-1)...
	<p>3 * (-10) = -30</p>
	<p>Factors of -30: </p>
	<p>(-6, 5) → -6 + 5 = -1 = -1</p>
	<p>(6, -5) → 6 - 5 = 1 &ne; -1</p>
	<p>(-10, 3) → -10 + 3 = -7 &ne; -1</p>
	<p>(10, -3) → 10 - 3 = 7 &ne; -1</p>
	<p>(30, -1) → 30 - 1 = 29 &ne; -1</p>
	<p>(-30, 1) → -30 + 1 = -29 &ne; -1</p>
	Since we've found our factor pair which multiplies to -30 and adds up to -1, we can then factor the quadratic normally...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - x - 10 = 0</p>
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> -6x + 5x - 10 = 0</p>
	<p>(3x<sup>2</sup> - 6x) + 5(x - 2) = 0</p>
	<p>3x(x - 2) + 5(x - 2) = 0</p>
	<p>(3x + 5)(x - 2) = 0</p>
	So...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - x - 10 = 0 → (3x + 5)(x - 2) = 0</p>
	<h3>Quadratic Cannot Be Factored At All</h3>
	If a quadratic cannot be factored at all, use the quadratic formula to get your roots, and for these quadratics, you have to factor out the coefficent of ax...
	<p>3x<sup>2</sup> - 5x - 10 = 0</p>
	First we factor out a from the quadratic...
	<p>3(x<sup>2</sup> - 5/3x - 10/3) = 0</p>
	Then we use the quadratic formula to find the roots which will then be plugged back into the quadratic...
