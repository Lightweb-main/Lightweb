		<h1>System of Equations: <br>Substitution and Elimination</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Systems of equations are groups which have 2 or more equations (commonly linear functions) and have two or more unknown values…
<p>2x + 3y = 12</p>
<p>-x + 2y = 6</p>
Systems of equations have only one solution and they can be solved through multiple strategies.

<h2>Substitution</h2> 
Substitution is when a variable is replaced with its values. For example, take a look at this system of equations…
<p>4x + 3y = 8</p>
<p>6x + 2y = 12</p>
This can be solved by what is known as substitution. First we would need to find the value of one variable in this system of equations. We can do that by isolating one variable, let's say for this example y. We would first have to move the 6x over to the other side. We can do this by subtracting 6x on both sides like this…
2y = 12 - 6x</p>
Remember, in substitution, you only have to focus on one equation to find out one of the variables like this. Guessing the values can work but can take a while to guess correctly. Next for this example, we would have to divide all sides by 2 to isolate y on its own…
<p>y = 6 - 3x</p>
Now that we found the value of y, we can substitute y in with either equation, let's pick the top one…
<p>4x + 18 - 9x = 8</p>
First we can remove the positive 18 by subtracting 18 from both sides…
<p>4x - 9x = -10</p>
Next we can combine like terms by subtracting 9x from 4x…
<p>-5x = -10</p>
We can then divide by 5 and cancel out the negative signs on both numbers…
<p>5x = 10</p>
<p>x = 2</p>
The final value of x equals 2. Now we can find the final value to y by plugging in x into the formula…
<p>y = 6 - 3(2)</p>
<p>y = 6 - 6</p>
<p>y = 0</p>
The final value of y is 0 which means that the solution for the system of equations is (2, 0). Remember that every system of equations has a solution and it is a pair of numbers like the following examples…
<p>(3, 2)</p>
<p>(1, 5)</p>
<p>(7, 6)</p>
<p>(4, 3)</p>

We can have another example like this one…
<p>2x + 2y = 10</p>
<p>5x + 4y = 6</p>
First, we would have to isolate one variable, to do this we can go to the second equation and subtract 5x from both sides…
<p>5x + 4y = 6</p>
<p>4y = 6 - 5x</p>
Next we can divide both sides by four to isolate y…
<p>y = 3/2 - 5/4x</p>
Sometimes you can run into a system of equations that include fractions but it is the same as solving a system of equations without them. We can then substitute y and its value into the first equation…
<p>5x + 6 - 5x = 6</p>
<p>5x - 5x = 0</p>
<p>0x = 0</p>
Looks like we did the wrong equation, when you find an equation that eliminates the variable like this one, we can’t find the value of it, therefore we would have to try the other equation…
<p>2x + 3 - 10/4x = 10</p>
<p>2x - 10/4x = 7</p>
<p>2x - 2.5x = 7</p>
<p>-0.5x = 7</p>
<p>-1x = 14</p>
<p>x = -14</p>
The final value of x is negative -14. Now we can solve for the value of y…
<p>1.5 - (-70/4)</p>
<p>70 / 4 = 17.5</p>
<p>1.5 - (17.5)</p>
<p>1.5 + 17.5 = 19</p>
<p>y = 19</p>
The final solution to 2x + 2y = 10 and 5x + 4y = 6 is (-14, 19).

Substitution is a great strategy to find the solutions of systems of equations but it isn’t the only method to find solutions.

<h2>Elimination</h2>
Elimination is another method to find solutions to systems of equations. Elimination involves canceling out variables to find the answer quickly. Let's say we had an example…
<p>4x + 6y = 12</p>
<p>7x + 5y = 18</p>
The first step of elimination is to make both equations have a variable the same coefficients. We can multiply the equations to get them to have the same coefficients for one variable…
<p>2x + 4y = 8</p>
<p>3x + 1y = 6</p>
<p>(2x + 4y = 8) * 3</p>
<p>(3x + 1y = 6) * 2</p>
<p>6x + 12y = 24</p>
<p>6x + 2y = 12</p>
Now we can subtract the equations…
<p>6x + 2y = 12</p>
     <p>6x - 12y = 24</p>
          <p>- 10y = -12</p>
Now divide both sides by 10…
                        <p>y = 1.2 = 6/5</p>
The final value of y is 6/5. Now we can solve for x…
<p>2x + 24/5 = 8</p>
<p>3x + 6/5 = 6</p>

<p>2x + 4.8 = 8
<p>3x + 1.2 = 6</p>

<p>2x = 3.2 </p>
<p>3x = 4.8</p>

<p>x = 1.6</p>
<p>x = 1.6</p>
The final solution for this system of equations is (1.6, 1.2).
