		<h1>The Pythagorean Theorem</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		The Pythagorean Theorem is an equation that can help find the hypotenuse of a triangle…
		<p>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></p>

		<h2>The Hypotenuse</h2>
		The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the longest side…
		<img src="../Images/PythaTh.img2.png">
		The hypotenuse’s length is the root of c2 in the Pythagorean Theorem.

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		The first example of the pythagorean theorem is a triangle with a length of 5 and with a width of 3…

		A is the smallest side of the triangle which is three in this example.
		<p>3<sup>2</sup> = 9</p>
B is the longer side relative to A but not bigger than the hypotenuse (c)...
		<p>5<sup>2</sup> = 25</p>
Using the pythagorean theorem formula…
		<p>9 + 25 = 34</p>
		<p>c<sup>2</sup> = 34</p>
We would have to square root both c and 34 to get the actual length of the hypotenuse…
		<p>c = &radic;34</p>
The length of the hypotenuse is the square root of 34…

But what if the hypotenuse and one of the sides are known…
		<img src="../Images/PythaTh.img5.png">
<p>c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>48 - 16 = 32</p>
<p>b<sup>2</sup> = 32</p>
<p>b = 32 ≈ 5.656</p>
The unknown side of this triangle is approximately 5.656 or the square root of 32…
