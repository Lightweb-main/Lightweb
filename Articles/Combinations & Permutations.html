	<h1>Combinations & Permutations</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Combinations and Permutations are both used to quantity the amount of sequences that can be done with <b>n</b> items.
	<h2>Combinations vs Permutations</h2>
	The two terms, "Combinations" and "Permutations" are different. Both are seperated <b>if the order of the sequence matters</b>. For example, putting the same books on a shelf randomly wouldn't include order since the bookshelf still has the same books, this is a combination which ignores order. Permutation is different, it takes into account of order, for example think of a lock that has the code of 12-24-54. Now the order matters since 24-12-54 or 54-12-24 both don't work, onlu 12-24-54 can.
	<h2>Repetition</h2>
	Repeititon really makes a difference into finding the total amount of combinations/permutations. For example, in a race, only one person can be 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, this is where repetition isn't allowed, however if repetition was allowed, two or more people can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on. Formulas may change with the addition of repetition.
	<h2>Calculating Permutations</h2>

	The formula to find the total amount of permutations with repetition is...
