		<h1>The Water Cycle</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Water cycle is described to be the continuous cycle of which water present on Earth gets recycled over and over again. The water system is called a closed system, meaning that no amount of water is lost. The water cycle consists of three main processes with water, evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.

<h2>Evaporation</h2>
Evaporation is the process by which liquid water turns into a gas, this gas is called water vapor and can be recognized by both words having the word “vapor” in them. This gas that was recently transformed into a gas slowly rises from the ground into the atmosphere where it slowly turns back into a liquid.

<h2>Condensation</h2>
Condensation is the process by which water vapor turns back into liquid water. This liquid water builds up in the atmosphere which forms a cloud. When this cloud contains too much liquid water, it releases liquid and solid water particles.

<h2>Precipitation</h2>
Precipitation is water from a cloud that has been released from a cloud and rapidly descends from the atmosphere back to land where it can replenish water storages like ponds or rivers. This is what is commonly known as rain. Rain is the constant barrage of water particles from the sky that crashes down from the atmosphere back to land. Precipitation can come in five different types, rain, sleet, hail, snow, and freezing rain.

<h2>Rain</h2>
Rain is the most common type of precipitation as it comes in liquid water. The dangers of rain precipitation is the possibility of accompanied lightning and power poles collapsing causing power outages in a certain region.

<h3>Sleet</h3>
Sleet is a rare type of precipitation as it comes in a solid (sometimes irregular shape) pellet of ice due to the freezing up in the atmosphere. Sleet is typically more dangerous than rain since it comes in a solid, meaning that collisions with a solid that is generally going about as faster, if not faster than a car can be very dangerous. One difference from Sleet from hail and freezing rain is that sleet actually previously a partially melted snowflake when they went through a layer of warm air, then freezing again in another layer of freezing air before colliding with the ground.  And sleet only forms during winter where temperatures are below the melting point of water.

<h3>Hail</h3>
Hail is another rare type of precipitation like sleet, which comes in a solid form of water (ice) due to freezing temperatures in the atmosphere. Unlike sleet, hail typically comes in the spring and is considered more dangerous and destructive than sleet. Hail can also be described to have hailstones which are bigger than sleet which can build up. Collisions with hailstones can result in serious injury and sometimes death.

<h3>Snow</h3>
Snow is a type of precipitation as it comes with frozen water (ice) in the shape of what we know as snowflakes. Snow isn’t as dangerous as sleet or hail but can build up over time which can be dangerous because of collapsing roofs of homes and the chilling temperatures that it brings. Snow is ice that remains in its form the whole way down from the atmosphere to the ground. Snow is typically enjoyed by people as it can be played around and can be molded into a snowman. Snow isn’t as fast as its other precipitation types as it slowly descends from the atmosphere to land.

<h3>Freezing Rain</h3>
Freezing rain is a type of precipitation similar to normal rain only. Instead, when it collides with the ground, it quickly turns back into a solid (ice). Freezing rain can be dangerous as ice can be slippery and stiff which can damage and cut off power from homes. Freezing rain can result in the ground being significantly  below the melting point of water (0 degrees celsius).

<h3>Runoff</h3>
Runoff is the leftover water that flows into a body of water like a sea or river that either evaporates or mixes with nearby soil which then starts transpiration.


<h2>Infiltration</h2>
Infiltration is the process of which precipitation/water travels through rocks which then results in liquid water mixing with soil.

<h2>Percolation</h2>
Percolation is the process by which liquid water travels through porous materials. Percolation is involved in the water cycle since           rocks underground can carry water which can benefit plants (eventually performing transpiration).

<h2>And the Cycle Continues</h2>
Shortly after precipitation has subsided, the water particles from precipitation get exposed to heat from the sun and turn into water vapor which is the process of evaporation and the cycle continues on and on.

<h2>Plant Processes</h2>
Plants also contribute to the water cycle as they need water to survive, they have a process by which they release water from their leaves.

<h3>Transpiration</h3>
Transpiration is the process by which plants release liquid water through their leaves and this causes evaporation. Transpiration is typically performed by plants when an excess amount of water is present which helps regulate moisture conditions for the plant. Transpiration doesn’t require any energy to perform and examples would be the dew that forms from trees and other tall plants early in the morning.

<h3>Evapotranspiration</h3>
Evapotranspiration is a term that combines evaporation and transpiration together. Evapotranspiration is typically used to measure a climates moisture condition, Thronwhites Climate Classification system is a great example of a climate classification that uses the term evapotranspiration to measure and classify  a climate.

<h2>Other Processes</h2>
Sometimes a form of water can be directly put into the water cycle and leftover water from precipitation can mix with the soil that plants are present with. Other Processes are just a list of processes that occur in a peculiar pattern that doesn’t follow the evaporation, condensation, and precipitation pattern.

<h3>Sublimation</h3>
Sublimation is the process by which ice or snow directly goes from a solid to a gas, this is called sublimation. Sublimation can take place on high mountains or in snowy environments with constant exposure to sunlight.

<h3>Deposition</h3>
Deposition is the process by which water vapor in the atmosphere goes straight from a gas to a solid, this process can be described as the complete opposite of sublimation. Deposition happens during the precipitation process where sometimes water vapors transform into ice (sleet & hail).
