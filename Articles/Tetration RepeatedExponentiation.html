		<h1>Tetration: Exponentiation but Faster</h1>
Tetration is a form of exponentiation that is associated with exponents on top of exponents. Tetration is not primarily used when the topic of measuring or comparing one object with another, but when the topic, “How big can numbers be?” Tetration is commonly brought up as one of the fastest ways to make a number turn into a bigger number.

Tetration is very similar to exponents where you multiply a number by itself a numerous amount of time. However, it can be visually different when a number is in the process of tetration or exponentiation…
<p>2<sup>2</sup>  Exponentiation</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>2  Tetration</p>
Now Exponentiation is when a number is multiplied by itself a number of times, Tetration is a number by the power of 2 by the power of a number. For example…
<p><sup>3</sup>2 =  2<sup>2<sup>2<sup></sup></sup></sup> = 2<sup>2 * 2</sup> = 2<sup>4</sup> = 16</p>
In this example, when the tetration value is 3, you are basically saying that in this example, 2 is being squared, then squared again. Now tetration when put with high numbers can be too big to even equate to…
<p><sup>4</sup>2 = 2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2<sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> = 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>2 = 2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> = 2<sup>256</sup> = 1.1E+77</p>
Note: 1.1E+77 is approximately 10 to the power of 77, that's 77 zeros! Think of the universe only having 1,000 times more atoms than this number.

Now a strategy for calculating Tetration is doing every exponent one at a time so in this example I would…
<p>2 * 2 = 4</p>
<p>4 * 4 = 16</p>
<p>16 * 16 = 256</p>
<p>2256 = 1.1E+77</p>
Now Tetration isn’t even close to the math equation that can yield the biggest numbers. Pentation is repeated Tetration and Hexation is repeated Pentation. So the exponents don’t even end with Tetration.

To explain the mathematical equations before Tetration. First there is addition where you add a number by a number…
<p>2 + 2 = 4</p>
Next, there is multiplication which is repeated addition…
<p>2 * 3 = 6    =    2 + 2 + 2</p>
Next, there is exponentiation which is repeated multiplication…
<p>2<sup>5</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32</p>
Next, there is Tetration which we covered in this google document which is repeated exponentiation…
<p>33 = 33 * 3 = 39 = 19683</p>
Next, there is Pentation which we covered in this google document which is repeated Tetration…
<p>2 ↑↑↑ 3 = 2 ↑↑ 2 ↑↑ 2 = <sup>4</sup>2 =2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup></sup> = 65,536</p>
Next, there is Hexation which we covered in this google document which is repeated Pentation…
<p>2 ↑↑↑↑ 2 = 2 ↑↑↑ 2 ↑↑↑ 2= <sup>4</sup>2 = 2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup></sup> = 65,536</p>
