		<h1>Logarithms: Introduction</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Logarithms (commonly referred to as log) are mathematical equations that are generally known as the opposite of exponentiation. A logarithmic equation always has the same fundamentals…
		<p>log<sub>10</sub>(x) = 2 </p>
		Logarithms sometimes have variables with potential solutions. Take a look at this example. We can convert this logarithm into an equation…
		<p>log<sub>10</sub>(x) = 2 </p>
		Move the ten on the left over to the other side...
		<p>x = 102</p>
		Now the small number on the right of the log is the base...
		<p>x = 10</p>
		Now the two that just got erased is the exponent...
		<p>x = 10<sup>2</sup></p>
		Now we could just replace the 10 to the power of 2 with 100...
		<p>x = 100</p>
And the final answer of this logarithmic equation is 100. Typically the base of the log equation is 10…
<p>log(100) = 2</p>
If there isn’t a base in the log equation it is most likely 10.
<p>log<sub>10</sub>(100) = 2</p>
<p>100 = 10<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>100 = 100</p>
This isn’t a false logarithm which means that the two numbers are equal. 
<br><br>Sometimes when calculating log equations, they sometimes don’t have solutions…
<p>log<sub>3</sub>(28) = 4</p>
<p>28 = 3<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>28 ≠ 81</p>
Since these two numbers are not equal, this log equation doesn’t have a solution.<br><br>
Log equations also sometimes have variables like x…
<p>log<sub>5</sub>(5x) = 4</p>
Since this log equation has a variable in it, there is a solution because x could be any value...
<p>5x = 54</p>
<p>5x = 625</p>
Divide both sides by 5
<p>x = 125</p>
Alternatively divide at the start.
<p>x = 5<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>x = 125</p>
This only covers the starting point of Logarithms as it gets exponentially complicated as more numbers are added. Here are just a few log equations being created and solved…

<p>log<sub>7</sub>(x<sup>2</sup>) = 2</p>
This one’s with exponents.
<p>x<sup>2</sup> = 72</p>
Also this one can have two solutions. 
First eliminate the exponents since they can cancel out.
<p>x = 7</p>
Negative numbers with even exponents are always positive.
<p>-7 * -7 = 49</p>
<p>x = -7</p>
The two final solutions
<p>x = 7</p>
<p>x = -7</p>

<p>log<sub>12</sub>(2x - 5) = 2</p>
This one includes a linear equation.
<p>2x - 5 = 122</p>
<p>2x - 5 = 144</p>
It’s just a linear equation.
<p>2x = 149 </p>
<p>x = 74.5 = 149/2</p>

<p>log<sub>12</sub>(45) = 2</p>
This includes a more complicated exponent.
<p>4<sup>5</sup> = 122</p>
<p>4<sup>5</sup> = 144</p>
<p>4<sup>1</sup> = 4</p>
<p>4<sup>2</sup> = 16</p>
<p>4<sup>3</sup> = 64</p>
<p>4<sup>4</sup> = 256</p>
<p>4<sup>5</sup> = 1024</p>
<p>1024 ≠ 144</p>
