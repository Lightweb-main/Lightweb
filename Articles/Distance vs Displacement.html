	<h1>Distance vs Displacement</h1> 
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Distance and Displacement are both mesaurements on how much land that has been covered. They are similar to each other but also have distinct differences.
	<h2>Distance</h2>
	Distance is the total amount of land that has been covered by an object. Distance can have twists, turns, curves, and straight lines. Distance can also include land that has been covered twice...

	For example, we can take a batter in a baseball game, the pitcher throws a curveball but the batter successfully hits it and makes a home run...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img2.png">
	Lets use the measurement that the distance from a base to another is 90ft. And the batter, now baserunner, went to the 1st base, then to the 2nd, then to the 3rd, then lastly stopped at home base...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img3.png">
	Since the baserunner ran 90ft four times. The total distance traveled is 360ft...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img4.png">
	Basically Distance is the total amount of land that has been traveled. 
	<h2>Displacement</h2>
	Displacement is different from distance. Instead of the total amount of land that has been traveled, the displacement is the difference between the final position and the starting position. Think of it as a vector or a straight line...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img5.png">
	Lets say that the batter this time during the baseball game instead runs to 2nd base in order to not be out...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img6.png">
	The displacement would be the final position (2nd base) subtracted by the starting position (home base)...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img7.png">
	Now the path from home base, to 1st base, and to 2nd base forms an isosceles triangle...
	<img src="../Images/DistDisplace.img8.png">
	We can use a form of the pythagorean theorem to find the displacement from home base to 2nd base...
