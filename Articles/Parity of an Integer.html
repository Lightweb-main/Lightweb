		<h1>Parity of a Number</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The parity of a number in mathematics is the term that either an integer is even or odd. For example, 2 and 4 have the same parity but 6 and 7 have opposite parities since 6 is an even number while 7 is an odd number.

<h2>Ways to Find Parity</h2>
There are a few ways to find the parity of a number but the most common is to divide said integer by 2…
<p>16/2 = 8 (EVEN)</p>
<p>51/2 = 25 R: 1 (ODD)</p>
<p>19/2 = 9 R:1 (ODD)</p>
<p>7/2 = 3 R:1 (ODD)</p>
<p>12/2 = 6 (EVEN)</p>
If the quotient is an integer, then the integer is even. But if the quotient has a remainder or has a decimal, that means that the integer is an odd number…
<p>2 ∣ x = Even Integer (x divides by 2)</p>
<p>2 ∤ x = Odd (x does not divide by 2)</p>
The parity of a number can also be expressed through a multiple variable equation…
<p>y = 2x</p>
The value of y is even because any odd number multiplied by an even number is always even. Now this is when y is an add number…
<p>y = 2x + 1</p>
The value of y now is odd because any even number plus 1 always equals odd, like how 2 + 1 = 3 or 6 + 1 = 7, both sums are odd numbers.

The parity of a number can also be expressed through sets…
<p>2k: k ∈ ℤ</p>
This is even because since k is an element (or just) an integer, then 2 * k equals an even number…
<p>{2k: k ∈ ℤ} = Even Number</p>
<p>{2k + 1: k ∈ ℤ} = Even Number</p>
