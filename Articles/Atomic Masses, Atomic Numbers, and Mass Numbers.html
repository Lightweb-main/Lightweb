	<h1>Atomic Masses, Atomic <br>Numbers, and Mass Numbers</h1>
	Atomic Numbers and Mass Numbers are both identities of certain elements  with Atomic Mass being the mass of a single atom (with entropes included). With every element, there is an atomic number, atomic mass and a mass number.
	<h2>Atomic Numbers</h2>
	The atomic number of an element is the amount of protons that are present within one atom of an element. In the periodic table, atomic numbers are shown at the top left corner of an element...

	So for example Oxygen (O) has 8 protons.
	<h2>Atomic Masses</h2>
	The atomic masses of an element is the average mass of all the isotropes in an element. In the periodic table, the atomic mass is the number at the bottom of the element either measured in amu or in daltons.

	<h2>Mass Numbers</h2>
	The mass number of an element is the combined amount of protons and neutrons in a single atom of an element. In the periodic table, the atomic mass is the number at the bottom of the element either measured in amu or in daltons.
