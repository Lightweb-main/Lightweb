	<h1>Absolute Value of Numbers</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	The Absolute Value of numbers is their distance away from zero. Basically the absolute value of a number is itself as a positive number…
	<p>|2| = 2</p>
	<p>|-3| = 3</p>
	<p>|6| = 6</p>
	<p>|-12| = 12</p>
	<p>|-73| = 73</p>
	The Absolute value of a number is always positive with only one exception…
	<p>- |2| = -2</p>
	<p>- |-7| = -7</p>
	<p>- |4| = -4</p>
	<p>- |-11| = -11</p>
	<p>- |-89| = -89</p>
	This example has a negative sign, which means that no matter what integer you put, you will always get a negative number.
	An absolute value cannot equal a negative number without a negative sign like this example…
	<p>|x| = -2</p>
	This example doesn’t have a solution since no matter what value x is, it can’t equal a negative number since its distance from zero cannot be negative therefore this equation has no solution…
	<p>|x| = -2</p>
	NO SOLUTION
	Absolute Values can also be used in linear equations as well…
	<p>3x + 2 = |-7| </p>
	<p>3x + 2 = 7</p>
	<p>3x = 5</p>
	<p>x = 5/3 = 1.666...</p>
	<p> |2x - 4| = 12</p>
	In this equation, there can be two separate answers.
	<p>2x - 4 = -12 or 2x - 4 = 12</p>
	<p>2x - 4 = -12</p>
	<p>2x = -8</p>
	<p>x = -4</p>
	<p>2x - 4 = 12</p>
	<p>2x = 16</p>
	<p>x  = 8</p>
 	<p>|4x - 7| < 24</p>
	<p>4x - 7 < 24  or  4x - 7 > -24</p>
	<p>4x - 7 < 24</p>
	<p>4x < 31</p>
	<p>x < 31/4</p>

	<p>4x - 7 > -24</p>
	<p>4x > -17</p>
	<p>x > -17/4</p>
	<p>-17/4<x<31/4</p><br><br>
