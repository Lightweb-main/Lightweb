	<h1>Momentum</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	In physics, Momentum is a <b>vector quantity</b> that is equal to the product of an objects mass and velocity. Momentum is usually stated as the 'quantity of motion' or in other words, how hard it is for external forces to stop it's motion.
	<h2>Comparison of Momentum Examples</h2>
	Different objects may have different momentum, meaning that some objects can easily stop objects objects motion while also getting stopped easily by others...

	<h2>Calculating  and Expressing Momentum</h2>
	To calculate the momentum of an object, you multiply the mass and the velocity of it...
	<p>P = mv</p>
	<p>Momentum is expressed through "P"</p>
	And momentum as expressed as a vector with speed and direction...

	<h2>Total Momentum</h2>
	Total Momentum in a system is the sum of the individual momenta (plural for momentum) of all the objects. Mathematically, it can be represented as...
	<p>m<sub>T</sub> = &Sigma;(m<sub>i</sub> * v<sub>i</sub>)</p>
	<p>&Sigma;: Represents the summation of something (in this case all the individual momenta of all the objects in a system)</p>
	This formula can be used to find the total momentum. For example...
	<p>Individual Velocities: 2 m/s, 5 m/s, 3 m/s</p>
	<p>Individual Masses: 7kg, 12kg, 4kg</p>
	If you are shown with individual velocities and masses, multiply each individual mass and velocity to get their momenta and then add them up (try to get m/s on its own without any coefficent)...
	<p>Object 1: 7kg * 2 m/s</p> 
	<p>Object 2: 12kg * 5 m/s</p> 
	<p>Object 3: 4kg * 3 m/s</p><br> 
	<p>Object 1: 14kg * m/s</p> 
	<p>Object 2: 60kg * m/s</p> 
	<p>Object 3: 12kg * m/s</p> 
	<p>Total Momentum: (14 + 60 + 12)kg * m/s</p>
	<p>Total Momentum: 86kg * m/s</p>
	And the total momentum is 86kg * m/s.
	<h2>The Law of Conservation of Momentum</h2>
	The Law of Conservation in Momentum is a fundamenatal law in physics that states that the total momentum in a closed system, or in others words where no external forces can act on the objects, remains unchanged over time. This law in more simplified is the total momentum before an event (ex. collision) is equal to after the collision. The Law of Conservation of Momentum when applied to two objects that are about to collide with each other can mathematically represented as...
	<p>m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>u<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>
	<p>m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>: The masses of object 1 (m<sub>1</sub>) and object 2 (m<sub>2</sub>).</p>
	<p>u<sub>1</sub> and u<sub>2</sub>: The intial velocities of object 1 (u<sub>1</sub>) and object 2 (u<sub>2</sub>).</p>
	<p>v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub>: The final velocities of object 1 (v<sub>1</sub>) and object 2 (v<sub>2</sub>).</p>
