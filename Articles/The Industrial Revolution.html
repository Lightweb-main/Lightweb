		<h1>The Industrial Revolution</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Industrial Revolution was a period of time when technological advancements which are still used today were invented / created / improved. This period of time was between the 1700s to the 1900s where agrarian cities slowly transformed into industrial cities. The Industrial Revolution is mainly described as a period of scientific and technological advancements that started in the 1750s and ended in the early 1900s where Western Europe and America would both transition their cities to be more industrialized and more efficient by the use of machines, hence the name of the revolution.

<h2>Origin</h2>
The Industrial Revolution started in the 1800s in Britain, this part of the Industrial Revolution is called the First Industrial Revolution. Soon after the revolution starting in Britain, it soon spread around the world and eventually in the United States.

<h2>Inventions</h2>
Many technological advancements were mainly newly invented machines and products that allowed further improvements in technological inventions.

<h2>Typewriters </h2>
In 1874, typewriters were invented, although the invention did not spark attention in offices until approaching the 1880s. Typewriters are devices used for a human to input a signal via pressing a key. Typewriters were very popular throughout the 1900s and are built in high end electrical devices.

<h2>Steam Power</h2>
While not being in the Industrial Revolution, steam power heavily contributed to the Industrial Revolution as it provided energy for further inventions in the Industrial Revolution. Steam Power was initially invented in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen. He was a metalworker in Devon, England that invented the  pump engine that pumps water underground back to the surface and clears out mines from flooding. The reason why Newcomen invented the pump engine was because of the problem that miners have with floods often blocking the miners.

The steam engine was then later improved by James Watt in 1764. Watt was given a task to repair one of Newcomen’s steam engines but then realized that it was inefficient. As a result, he wanted to improve the design of the invention. He was successful with improving it by adding a separate condensing chamber that blocks steam from escaping out of the engine.

Throughout the 1800s, steam power was later integrated into other inventions. Examples of this are the inventions of the steam boat which was made by Robert Fulton in 1806 and the steam train by George Stephenson in 1814.

<h2>Electric Batteries </h2>
In the 1900s, electrical batteries were invented. This invention was crucial in the Industrial revolution as it was deemed as ‘portable power’, batteries could be used anywhere. Electrical Batteries were first invented by Allessandro Volta, an Italian physicist and chemist in 1800. Volta’s batteries were alternating zinc and copper plates which were separated by flannels which were coated in brine. This copper and zinc creation was named the “Voltaic Cell” or “Voltaic Pile”. In the year 1836 a British scientist named John Frederic Daniell created improved batteries through making copper and zinc in sulfuric acid. These batteries made by John Frederic Daniell were far more efficient than Allessandro Volta invented 30 years ago.
