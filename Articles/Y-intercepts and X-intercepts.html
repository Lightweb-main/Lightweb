	<h1>Y-intercepts and X-intercepts</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Y-intercepts and X-intercepts are points in a function that either cross the y-axis (the line that goes up) and the x-axis (the line that goes straight)...
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img1.png">
	Y-intercepts are points that cross the y-axis, examples may include...
	<p>(0, 2)</p>
	<p>(0, -3)</p>
	<p>(0, 1)</p>
	X-intercepts are points that cross the x-axis, examples may include...
	<p>(2, 0)</p>
	<p>(-3, 0)</p>
	<p>(6, 0)</p>
	<h2>Y-intercepts</h2>
	Y-intercepts mentioned before are points that cross the y-axis (the line that points up)...
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img2.png">
	In slope intercept form, the y-intercept appears as, "b"...
	<p>y = mx + <b>b</b></p>
	To find the y-intercept in different forms of functions require different steps.<br>
	<h3>Finding Y-intercepts in standard form</h3>
	To find y-intercepts in standard form or Ax + By = C. Substitute x as 0, so for example...
	<p>5x + 3y = 21</p>
	So in this function, we substitute x as 0...
	<p>When x = 0</p>
	<p>5(0) + 3y = 21</p>
	<p>3y = 21</p>
	Now we divide both sides by 3...
	<p>y = 7</p>
	So the y-intercept of this function is (0, 7) or when the y equals 7...
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img3.png">
	This strategy can be applied to slope-intercept form when the function's formula is known...
	<p>y = 2x - 4</p>
	Same thing as last time, we substitute x as 0...
	<p>When x = 0</p>
	<p>y = 2(0) - 4</p>
	Now we evaluate the function...
	<p>y = 0 - 4</p>
	<p>y = -4</p>
	So the y-intercept of this is -4 or (0, -4)...
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img4.png">
	Now to solve the y-intercept(s) of a function only knowing the slope and one given point is different. <br><br>
	To solve for a y-intercept knowing only the slope and one point on the line, first subsitute y in y = mx + b as the y value in the coordinate of the given point, and do the same thing for x. For example...
	<p>y = (2/3)x + b</p>
	<p>One given point is (6, 13)</p>
	First we substitute x and y...
	<p>13 = (2/3) * 6 + b</p>
	<p>13 = 12/3 + b</p>
	<p>13 = 4 + b</p>
	<p>9 = b</p>
	So the y-intercept of this function is 9.
	<h2>X-intercepts</h2>
	X-intercepts are points that cross the x-axis...
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img5.png">
	The x-intercept of a function in slope interecpt form are noted with, "x" in y = mx + x...
	<p>y = m<b>x</b> + b</p>
	X-intercepts are found similar to y-intercepts, except you substitute x instead of y. For example in standard form...
	<p>-4x + 2y = 18</p>
	So instead of substituting x as 0, we substitute y as 0...
	<p>When y = 0</p>
	<p>-4x + 2(0) = 18</p>
	<p>-4x + 0 = 18</p>
	<p>-4x = 18</p>
	<p>4x = -18</p>
	<p>x = -4.5</p>
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img6.png">
	So the x-intercept of this function is -4.5 or (-4.5, 0). To find an x-intercept in slope intercept form, do the same thing...
	<p>y = 4x - 8</p>
	<p>When y = 0</p>
	<p>0 = 4x - 8</p>
	<p>8 = 4x </p>
	<p>2 = x</p>
	The x-intercept of this function is 2 or (2, 0).
	<img src="../Images/XY-intercepts.img7.png">
	Now to find the x-intercept of a function only knowing the slope and one point, you must calculate the y-intercept of the function, so for example...
	<p>y = -x + b</p>
	<p>A point (4, 2) is given</p>
	We substitute the values and first find the y-intercept...
	<p>2 = -(4) + b</p>
	<p>2 = -4 + b</p>
	<p>6 = b</p>
	Now that we know the y-intercept, which is 6, we can solve for the x-intercept...
	<p>Since b = 6</p>
	<p>y = -x + 6</p>
	<p>When y = 0</p>
	<p>0 = -x + 6</p>
	<p>-6 = -x</p>
	<p>6 = x</p>
	Now we know the x-intercept, which is also 6...
	<p>y = -x + 6</p>
