		<h1>Radius, Diameter & Circumference</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Before you read the text below you have to remember that, Radius, Diameter and Circumference are NOT the same. Sure they are relative to each other but they are different from each other.
<h2>Radius of a Circle</h2>
Radius is the halfway point of a circle. It is used to calculate the Diameter, Area, and Volume of a circle. Now to better depict this, first draw a circle...

Now imagine a line that just went halfway through the circle like this...
<img src="../Images/RadDiaCirAr.img2.png">
That line that just went about halfway through the circle is the radius of the circle. Now there are a few formulas to calculate a circle's radius. One is to divide the diameter by two, by doing this you would get the radius...
<h2>Radius of a Semicircle</h2>
The radius of a semi circle can be calculated through its base. The part where the two separate semi circles intersect is the base of both of the two semi circles. That line is the diameter and a diameter is twice the radius. So dividing the diameter by two equals the radius...

<h2>Area of a Semicircle</h2>
The area of a semi circle can be calculated in two ways, you can get the area of the whole circle and then divide it by 2 to get one of the semi circles area. You can do them individually to get their area. The same formula applies to semi circles but instead of keeping the product as is. After you multiply the radius squared times pi, you divide the product by two since a semi circle occupies 50 percent of the whole circle...

<h2>Circumference of a semi circle</h2>
The circumference of a semicircle is a little different compared to calculating for a whole circle. Instead you would have to find the diameter of the semi circle. The direction of the split does matter. If the circle is looking like this, then find the radius of it then multiply it by 2, then multiply it by pi...

<h2>Diameter of a Circle</h2>
The diameter of a circle is the distance from one point on the left all the way to the right. Unlike a chord or radius of a circle. The diameter of a circle is very precise, it is twice the distance of the radius of the circle. And it is found to find the circumference of a circle easily...

<h2>Circumference of a Circle</h2>
The Circumference of a Circle is the area around the circle, basically the circumference of a circle is the perimeter of it. The formula is the diameter times pi (𝜋). Some math problems use 3.14 as pi to simplify it. Some may use 3.14159 as pi. Pi is endless so most math problems specify that 3.14 or 3.14159 is 𝜋. Also the Radius times two times pi also equals the Circumference. Note that some answers require the exact amount of pi.

The circumference is not the same as the area of a circle. The area has a totally different formula.
Area of a Circle
The Area of a circle can get quite complicated, its formula contains exponents and multiple step calculations. But the area of a circle is the entirety of it within itself. The Formula of the Area of a Circle is the radius squared times pi. (𝜋r<sup>2</sup>) Make sure to do the exponents first before multiplying. PEMDAS.

<h3>Quick Note</h3>
Some problems require the unsimplified version of pi (3.14159) and some just use 3.14, just multiply by 3.14159 or more numbers just to be safe unless there is a note that says use 3.14 as pi.
<h2>Quick Formulas</h2>
<br><br>Diameter = 2 * radius OR  Circumference / 3.14 (SIMPLIFIED PI)
<br><br>Radius = Diameter / 2 OR  Circumference / 3.14 / 2 (SIMPLIFIED PI)
<br><br>Circumference = Diameter * 3.14 (SIMPLIFIED PI)
<br><br>Area = radius<sup>2</sup> * 3.14 OR  radius * radius * 3.14 (SIMPLIFIED PI)
