		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Earth is a planet, which means that the life on the ground and the composition of it are coexisting. Both work together to make Earth feel like home. The Earth isn’t just a big rock in space, it has layers within it that create our gravity and magnetic field. Every layer does something unique and the most important are the lithosphere and the asthenosphere. In fact you are standing (or sitting) on the lithosphere right now. 
<h2>The Layers of the Earth</h2> 
The Earth is not just one big rock, it has layers within it, with the crust being the outermost layer and the core being the innermost layer which temperatures can be compared to that of the sun. Starting on the ground is the crust.

<h3>The Crust</h3>
The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, having an average thickness of 19 kilometers to 200 kilometers from the surface. The crust is extremely important because without it, heat from the core will burn the ground and make the floor actually lava. The Crust can be classified as two different types, Oceanic and Continental. Oceanic crust is the crust underneath the oceans. Continental Crust is the crust that is on land. 

<h3>The Mantle</h3>
The Mantle is the layer beneath the crust and contains all the heat coming from the core. This layer is split in two sections, the Upper Mantle and the Lower Mantle. The Upper Mantle is where The Mantle is also an extremely important layer of the Earth as it helps transport convection currents to the lithosphere (more later). The Mantle contains two thirds the mass of the Earth and is about 84 percent of the Earth’s composition. It also is known for its extreme heat as temperatures can vary from 1,000 degrees celsius to 3,600 degrees celsius as one gets closer to the core.
<h3>The Lithosphere</h3>
The Lithosphere is the section of the Crust and the Upper Mantle where land is located. The Lithosphere is broken up into plates which include the seven continents and all the islands (remote or not) together. 300 - 200 million years ago, the lithosphere was one supercontinent known as Pangea. But slowly over time the lithosphere broke apart which forms the landmasses that we know today. This is known as the Continental Drift Theory. 

<h3>Convection Currents & Asthenosphere</h3>
The Asthenosphere is the semi liquid layer and contains the upper mantle which is right beneath the Lithosphere where a driving force called convection currents move the plates in the lithosphere. Convection currents are the reason why the continents broke off from each other over time and slowly drifted to the places we know today. The temperatures in the asthenosphere are more extreme than the Mantle’s as the point where the Lithosphere and the Asthenosphere are separated is above 1,400 degrees celsius. Convection currents are formed through the difference in liquid density due to the extreme temperatures in the Asthenosphere. These Convection currents then cause the plates to move which caused Pangea to break apart. This introduces Plate Boundaries which is below the few topics below this one.

<h3>Lower Mantle (Mesosphere)</h3>
The Lower Mantle (also referred to as the Mesosphere but not commonly due to confusion over the term mesosphere in the atmosphere), is the layer of Earth below the upper mantle (as the Asthenosphere) but a more rigid and immovable layer than it. What contrasts the lower mantle from the upper mantle is the difference in temperature and pressure. The lower mantle experiences much greater temperatures and pressures than the upper part of the mantle. Convection also comes from the lower mantle although not as much as present in the Asthenosphere.

<h3>The Core</h3>
The Core is the centered part of the Earth where the highest temperatures can be compared to that of the sun. The Core is split into two parts, the solid layer and the liquid layer.

<h4>The Outer Core</h4>
 The liquid layer of the core is called the outer core where liquid iron and nickel is present. The outer core is the creator of the Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field is a field around Earth as an oval shape that protects us from powerful solar flares from the sun.

<h4>The Inner Core</h4>
The Solid layer of the core is called the inner core where layers of burning, solid iron and nickel are found. The inner core is often depicted as a ball of iron and nickel, while it might be the innermost layer of the Earth, it is the reason that everything isn’t flying into space. The Inner core is the reason why we have our gravity here on Earth.


<h2>Continental Drift Theory</h2>
The Continental Drift Theory is the theory that all the landmasses on Earth were together as one supercontinent known as Pangea. But as time progressed, the landmasses slowly broke apart and moved into the places that we know today. This was known as the Continental Drift theory and its origin comes from Alfred Wegener. He was a Germanic Geologist that was born in 1880 and was the person who first created the Continental Drift theory. His hypothesis was that the lithosphere slowly broke apart over hundreds of millions of years. His evidence for his claim was that identical fossils were found on different continents, confirming that ancient animals can just cross from one continent to another. He also pointed out that similar terrain (ex. rocks) was found on different continents just like fossils. More evidence can include the continents' shape, they are like a jigsaw puzzle, like South America and Africa, their coastlines can connect to each other. Glacier deposits can also suggest that the landmasses were closer to the poles which in present days experience warm temperatures (lands near the poles typically have lower temperatures). Back in the 1930s when Wegener proposed this theory, scientists didn’t believe the theory as they demanded an explanation to how the plates moved. Wegener has evidence that the plates had moved but didn’t know how they moved. Because of this, scientists did not believe Wegner. And around the same time, Alfred Wegener died in Greenland while trying to find more evidence. 

<h2>Plate Tectonics Theory</h2>
Plate Tectonics is the theory that the Earth’s lithosphere is divided into plates which are constantly moving around for billions of years. The Plate Tectonics theory is actually a buildup of new ideas from Wegener’s Continental Drift theory. Plate tectonics introduces new ideas like seafloor spreading, mantle convection and Plate Boundaries (more later). A good analogy between the relationship between Plate Tectonics and Continental Drift is like saying that Plate Tectonics are the cause while Continental Drift is the evidence that comes along with it. However unlike the Continental Drift theory, plate tectonics also involves natural disasters that are involved with plates like volcanoes and earthquakes. 
<h2>The Two Types of Crust</h2>
The Crust on Earth has two types, Oceanic and Continental. Oceanic crust is crust underneath a body of water, Continental crust is the crust that is beneath a landmass. The two types of crust are crucial to understand the formation of geographic features.

<h2>Plate Boundaries</h2>
Sometimes when plates move due to convection currents, they can collide with each other. This is called Plate Boundaries. Plate Boundaries are the main catalyst of many geographic features like mountains & valleys. The geographic feature that forms depends on the two plates type. If the two plates are moving towards each other and are about to collide with each other, it is a convergent boundary. If the two plates are moving away from each other, it is a divergent boundary. If the two plates are colliding with each other but aren’t going towards or away from each other, it is a transform boundary. 
<h2>Convergent Boundaries</h2>
Convergent Boundaries are when two plates move towards each other, eventually causing collision and destroying underground crust. Convergent Boundaries can sometimes cause the process of subduction. There are four geological features that can be formed through Convergent Boundaries. The first geological feature are mountains like the Himlayas or the Alps, which are formed through two continental plates colliding towards each other which forces crust to build up and create mountains. The second and third geological feature that can be formed are volcanoes which can be formed through one continental and oceanic plate colliding towards each other. The last geographic feature is formed through two oceanic plates colliding towards each other which forms island arcs which are chains of active volcanoes, Hawaii is a great example of this occurrence. 



<h2>Divergent Boundaries</h2>
Divergent Boundaries are when two plates move away from each other and a new crust is created. Like convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries form several geographic features. The first geographic feature that can be formed are two continental plates moving away from each other which form rift valleys. The second and third geographic features that are formed are Mid-Ocean ridges which are mountain ranges that are underwater take the Mid-Atlantic Ridge as an example and seafloor spreading which is the formation of new oceanic crust, with the older oceanic crust being found near the continents (The Mediterranean being the oldest).

<h2>Transform Boundaries</h2>
Transform boundaries are when two plates are colliding with each other but not directly like convergent boundaries (usually horizontally) and the crust is unaffected (not destroyed nor created). Transform Boundaries can cause earthquakes which are sudden shaking forces that damage landscape and property. Faults are also formed which are cracks on the surface like the San Andreas fault.
<h2>Subduction</h2>
Subduction is the geological process of an oceanic crust that forcefully moves under the continental crust when both are moving towards each other. Subduction can form deep ocean trenches and destroy parts of the lithosphere causing it to turn into magma, this can also form volcanoes which can trigger eruptions. The area that subduction is occurring is called the subduction zone and is where the crust is being destroyed.
