		<h1>Logarithms: Natural Logarithms</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Natural Logarithms are log equations that have Euler’s Number (Shown as e) as the base. Natural Logarithms are used to accurately estimate exponential growth. Examples of Natural Logarithms are…
<p>log<sub>e</sub>(x) = 3</p>
This isn’t the only way that Natural Logarithms are written.
<p>ln(1) = 0</p>
Remember that any logarithm with a base of 1 always equals zero.
<p>e<sup>ln(x)</sup> = x</p>
Above me is the formula for natural logarithms.
<p>log<sub>e</sub>(5) = ln(5)</p>
Both above me are equal to each other despite being written differently.
There are a few methods that can solve Natural Logarithms. First we can cancel out two identical values like e…
<p>e<sup>3 ln(4y)</sup> = ???</p>
Since a natural logarithm has the base e, we can show it to cancel it out.
<p>e<sup>3 ln<sub>e</sub>(4y)</sup> = ???</p>
Now we can cancel out the identical values (in this case e)
<p>ln<sub>3</sub>(y) = ???</p>
Now we can solve it.</p>
<p>ln<sub>3</sub>(y) = ???</p>
<p>ln<sub>3</sub>(y) = y<sup>3</sup></p>
The final answer is y cubed. We can also do this with two numbers being the same value like this example…
<p>3<sup>log<sub>3</sub>(5)</sup> = ???</p>
We can cancel out the two threes.
<p>log(5) = ?</p>
Since no base is here, it is the number in the brackets.
<p>log(5) = 5</p>
