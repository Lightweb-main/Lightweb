		<h1>Mathematical Sequences</h1> 
    	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    	Mathematical Sequences are a list of numbers that are in order and have a set <b>rule</b> that every term follows...
		<p>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...}</p>
		<h2>Sequences Notation</h2>
		Sequences are noted as a list of items all seperated by a comma (,) with {curly brackets} around the sequences...
		<p>{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 23}</p>
		<h2>The Structure of a Sequence</h2>
		Every sequence usually has a rule, which is a constant formula used to find the next value of every term by a relative term...
		<p>Rule = 2<sup>n</sup></p>
		<p>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}</p>
		Every individual 'object' in a sequence is called a <b>term</b>. So for the sequence above, the 1st term is 1, the 4th is 8, and the last term (9th) term is 128.
