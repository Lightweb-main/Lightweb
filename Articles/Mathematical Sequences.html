		<h1>Mathematical Sequences</h1> 
    	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    	Mathematical Sequences are a list of numbers that are in order and have a set <b>rule</b> that every term follows...
		<p>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...}</p>
		<h2>Sequences Notation</h2>
		Sequences are noted as a list of items all seperated by a comma (,) with {curly brackets} around the sequences...
		<p>{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 23}</p>
		<h2>The Structure of a Sequence</h2>
		Every sequence usually has a rule, which is a constant formula used to find the next value of every term by a relative term...
		<p>Rule = 2<sup>n</sup></p>
		<p>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}</p>
		Every individual 'object' in a sequence is called a <b>term</b>. So for the sequence above, the 1st term is 1, the 4th is 8, and the last term (9th) term is 128. 
		<h2>Infinite and Finite Sequences</h2>
		Sequences can also be divided into two categories depending on if they continue to infinity (or negative infinity). Sets that are limited to a known value are called <b>finite sequences</b> like these examples...
		<p>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
		<p>{2, 4, 6, 8}</p>
		<p>{5, 10, 15}</p>
		Infinite sets are sets that continue to an undefinite value are noted with three dots...
		<p>{-1, -2, -3...}</p>
		<p>{1, 2, 3...}</p>
		<p>{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...}</p>
		<h2>Special Sequences</h2>
		Some sequences are considered to be special like the arithmetic sequence, or the geometric sequence. 
		<h3>Arithmetic Sequence</h3>
		The arithmetic sequence is made through a pattern of numbers all being added up by the same number, take this for example...
		<p>{1, 2, 3, 4, ???}</p>
		Naturally the next number to follow is 5 since every term after the previous is it's <b>successor</b> number. Now arithmetic sequences aren't just limited to keep adding 1 for each term, <b>any sequence that keeps adding the next term by a certain number is considered a arithmetic sequence</b>...
		<p>{8, 16, 24, 32, 40...}</p>
		<p>{6, 12, 18, 24, 32, 38, 44, 50...}</p>
		Think of it as a formula...
		<p>nth term = nth term * 2</p>
		<p>{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}</p>
		<h3>Geometric Sequences</h3>
		Geometric sequences are sequences that instead multiply the next term by a certain number, instead of adding a term with a certain number, we multiply the term with the number...
		<p>{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}</p>
		As a formula it would look like this...
		<p>nth term = 2<sup>n - 1</sup></p>
		This can also apply to any sequence multipling the next term by a number...
		<p>{4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096, 16384, 65536...}</p>
		<h3>Quadratic Sequences</h3>
		Quadratic Sequences are sequences that instead have the number that is being added/subtracted to also increase alongisde the amount of terms being added, we usually call that number the <b>second difference</b>. Here's an example...
		<p>{1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29...}</p>
		Notice how the second difference keeps increasing, if we took all the numbers being added with their own respective terms, we get...
		<p>{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}</p>
		The second difference can also be subtracted/added by a greater/lesser number as well...
		<p>{1, -1, -3, -6, -10, -15}</p>
		<p>{0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5}</p>
		<h3>Harmonic Sequences</h3>
		A harmonic sequence is a special sequence that instead takes the reciprocal of all the terms inside the sequence...

		<h3>Triangle Sequence</h3>
		The triangle sequence is a special sequence that deals with triangle numbers, or numbers that create a perfect triangle (w/ dots)...
		<p>{1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36...}</p>
		<h3>Fibonaccis Sequence</h3>
		Fibonnacis sequence is considered to be a very special sequence due to its unique nature of the next term being the sum of the previous two terms, kind of like a quadratic sequence...
		<p>{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...}</p>
		<h3>Sqaure Numbers Sequence</h3>
		The sqaure numbers sequence is a sequence containing all the sqaure numbers in numerical order...
		<p>{1, 3, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196...}</p>
		<h3>Cube Numbers Sequence</h3>
		The cube numbers sequence is a sequence containing all the cube numbers in numerical order...
		<p>{1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729}</p>
