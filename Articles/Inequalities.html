		<h1>Inequalities </h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Inequalities are equations that include two values that are not equal and have a comparison sign in between them like these…
		<p><</p>
		<p>></p>
		Inequalities often contain variables and can be similar to linear equations. And inequalities are usually shown on a number line...
		<br>An example of a inequality is this...
		<p> X > 3</p>
		And this is a number line. Number lines are lines with numbers on the bottom to help picture numbers in between, greater or less than another number…

		And for the example above, X is greater than three. The number line would look like this…

		Notice that the circle on the start of the line is open (the inside of the circle isn’t filled in). This is important to tell if the comparison sign also has the equal to function or not. 

		<h2>Equal to signs</h2>
		Comparison signs can have an extra line on the bottom of the main sign on the top like this…
		<p>≤</p>
		<p>≥</p>		
		These signs are special because they can mean two things. First the first sign on the top can mean, “less than or equal to”, and the second sign means, “greater than or equal to”. Remember if the comparison sign has an extra line on the bottom, it also includes numbers equal to the value on the right.
		Signs also affect the circle at the beginning of a line in a number line, if the comparison sign doesn’t have a equal sign, it would show an open circle in the number line like this…

		Signs that also have the equal sign will show a closed circle instead...

		<h2>Linear Inequalities</h2>
Linear Inequalities are inequalities that contain variables like linear equations. In fact, this type of inequality is very similar to linear equations, both follow a process of elimination. Let's say we had a linear problem like this…
<p>x + 5 > 12</p>
We would subtract 5 from both sides and the problem is complete…

<p>x > 7</p>
But linear inequalities can get harder…

<p>(-x * 5) - 15 > 90</p>
Now this may seem hard but this is just like linear equations which can be broken down step by step. First, we would have to multiply negative x with 5 which is -5x…
<p>-5x - 15 > 90</p>
Next, we would have to remove the negative 15 on the left side of the inequality…
<p>-5x > 105</p>
And this is where things change since we would have to divide both sides by -5. When dividing or multiplying with a negative number on both sides, you would have to switch the comparison sign to the opposite side. So for this problem, 105 divided by -5 equals -21. 
<p>x < -21</p>
This says that to make the equation true, numbers would have to be smaller than negative 21.
