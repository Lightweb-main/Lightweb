		<h1>Exponential Equations</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Exponential Equations are equations that have powers with exponents that are variables like this…
<p>2x = 24</p>
Solving the Different Types of Exponential Equations
There are multiple types of exponential equations, the easiest being two powers equal to each other with the same base with one of the powers having an exponent that is a variable…
<p>2x = 24</p>
For these equations, just look at what 2 to the power of x equals, in this example, 2 to the power of x equals 2 to the power of 4. This means that the only value that x could be is 4 because anything below or above it would result in this equation being false…
<p>2<sup>x = 5</sup> = 2<sup>4</sup>  TOO BIG
<br><br>2<sup>x = 3 </sup>= 2<sup>4</sup>  TOO SMALL
<br><br>2<sup>x = 4</sup> = 2<sup>4</sup>  CORRECT</p>
The formula of finding the answers to these equations is when the two numbers have the same base, then the first exponent is equal to the second exponent…
<p>a<sup>x</sup> = a<sup>y</sup>
<br><br>x = y</p>
Another type of exponential equation is when two powers are equal, both have different bases but one can be turned to have equal bases like this one…
<p>5<sup>x</sup> = 625</p>
To solve these equations, first look at what 5 to the power of x equals, in this example 625 is just 5 to the power of 4…
<p>5<sup>x</sup> = 625 = 5<sup>4</sup>
<br><br>5<sup>x</sup> = 5<sup>4</sup></p>
Now we are left with 5 to the power of x equals 5 to the power of 4, just like the last example, x = y so in this example x = 4…
<p>5<sup>x</sup> = 5<sup>4</sup>
<br><br>x = 4</p>
Some equations have a variable exponent with an additional number like this…
<p>7<sup>x + 2</sup> = 49</p>
To solve these equations, first look at what the base is to the power of the whole number. In this example, 7 to the power is 49…
<p>7<sup>x + 2</sup> = 49
<br><br>7<sup>2</sup> = 49
<br><br>Since 7 squared is equal to 7 to the power of x + 2. x is 0 because 72</sup> = 49…
<br><br>7<sup>0 + 2</sup> = 49
<br><br>7<sup>2</sup> = 49</p>
Some equations have the bases of each power not equal and both cannot be simplified to be equal like for the previous example…
<p>8<sup>x</sup>  = 6</p>
We would have to use logarithms to get the value of x. The formula of x when the bases are not the same and cannot be changed is…
<p>a<sup>x</sup> = b —> log<sub>a</sub>(b) = x</p>
This is logarithmic form where powers are shown with logarithms, powers with a big number with a small number in the upper right are shown in exponential form. The value of x is equal to the log of 6 divided by the log of 8…
<p>8<sup>x</sup>  = 6
<br><br>x = log(6) / log(8) = 0.862
<br><br>So 8 to the power of 0.862 is 6…
<br><br>8<sup>0.862</sup>  = 6</p>
This is called the change of base property. Another method to find x is to apply the logarithm on both sides…
<p>log 8<sup>x</sup> = log 6</p>
Then the next step is to use the property log ax = x log a…
<p>x log(8) = log(6)</p>
Then we divide both sides by the log of 8 which brings us to the previous method…
<p>x = log(6) / log(8).<p>
Both methods can be used to get the answer.
