	<h1>Probability Distribution</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Probability Distribution in statistics is a description for a variable, basically teliing how much outcomes are favorable in the variable. For example, take a dice for example, a dice usually has 6 sides, every sides probability is 1/6 since there's only one iteration of it and there are 6 of them in total. This is what is known as <b>discrete probability distribution</b> where the group of possible outcomes is <b>finite</b> or countable.
	<h2>Probability Distribution Rules</h2>
	Even though there are many types of probability distribution, there are some rules they all need to meet. First, all of the probabilities need to be greater than or equal to 0 since they cannot have a negative probability. And second, the sum of all the probabilities needs to equal 1, this is becuase 1 equals 100% and events cannot happen 101 percent of the time for example.
	<h2>The Mean of a Probability Distribution</h2>
	The mean of a probability distribution can be calculated through multiplying all the probabilities by their respectiable variables and then dividing the sum by the total amount of probabilities, for example a six sided dice...

		<mn>6</mn>
	</mfrac>
	</math><br><br><br><br>
			<br><br><br><br><math display="block">
	<mfrac>
		<mn>3.5</mn>
	</mfrac>
	</math><br><br><br><br>
	So the mean of the six sided dice is 3.5.
