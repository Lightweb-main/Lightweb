		<h1>The Butterfly Effect</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Butterfly Effect is a part of chaos theory often described as a metaphor in which seemingly insignificant events can alter the future in an unpredictable and major way. A famous example would be someone traveling back to the past and changing properties in that time. Once they travel back to their time, things have changed in that time since things in the past have impacted the future which could have not happened if they had not been altered. This alteration is called the Butterfly Effect and can be connected to other effects like Hindsight. The Butterfly effect was originally theorized by Edward Lorenz, an American MIT Mathematician and Meteorologist who established the basics of weather & climate predictability and thought that small changes in the weather created drastic changes in climate. 

<h2>Over Exaggeration </h2>
The Butterfly effect is often used as humor as one makes a small impact like skipping a rock leads to many world changing events being altered or in some cases completely erased. Some movies reference the butterfly effect to alter parts in the storyline (especially ones that have to do with time).

<h2>Why “Butterfly”?</h2>
The reason why the Butterfly effect is named that is when Lorenz noticed that a tornado can hypothetically be formed by the tiniest things in an ecosystem like a butterfly. This is what gave the effect the name, “The Butterfly Effect”.
