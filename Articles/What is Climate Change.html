		<h1>What is Climate Change?</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Climate Change is the process of climates all around the world changing at a rapid pace. Climate Change is often dismissed by people since the world won’t be seeing any drastic change in the next century or so, but ever since the increase of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the many other man made activities that can damage the Earth’s atmosphere, Climate Change is a significant problem that humans are facing.
<h2>Climate is not Weather</h2>
There is often confusion about what is different between climate and weather. Weather changes all the time, every day, the weather is always different. Now when we are talking about climate, this is a different view, climate is the progression between decades (sometimes even centuries) that the annual precipitation, temperature, and humidity changes. So the difference between Weather and Climate are the time periods that you are comparing them to. When you are comparing over days, then that points to weather. If you are studying the change of annual precipitation, temperature, and humidity over years or decades, you are then studying the changes in climate.
<p>“If you don’t like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.”</p>
<p>- Mark Twain</p>
<h2>Potential Benefits  </h2>
Now Climate Change isn’t always a bad thing. Although the chances of Climate Change being “Beneficial” are very low, sometimes Climate Change can shift in our favor. For example, if a climates average temperature drops by 2 degrees celsius (3.16 degrees fahrenheit), crops that prefer cold temperature are going to thrive in these conditions, now that comes with a double edged sword since crops that prefer hot climates are not going to thrive in these conditions. Agriculture benefits are one of the many potential good things that climate change can do for us. Another example is the melting of ice caps, sure this can lead to an increase in sea levels (by only a miniscule bit) but it can open the way for traveling to other countries.
<h2>Downsides of Climate Change</h2>
Now the pros of Climate Change are quickly overshadowed by the various cons that Climate Change has. First thing, due to an abundance of greenhouse gases present in the air, the average temperature of the Earth goes up. This increase in temperature can lead to famine, heat related conditions, and many more cons that can disrupt an environment. Second, Climate Change can cause more frequent and dangerous natural disasters that are linked to the average temperature of Earth. For example, a hurricane's intensity is mainly dependent on the temperature of the environment that it is forming in. This increased intensity in hurricanes can cause even more damage to regions.
