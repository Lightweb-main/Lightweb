	<h1>Mathematical Functions</h1>
	<h2>Introductions</h2>
	Functions in mathematics are a relationship between inputs and outputs…
	<table>
	<tr>
	<th>X</th>
	<th>Y</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>9</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>16</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>5</td>
	<td>25</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>36</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
Functions don’t have to be in numerical order…<br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
	<th>X</th>
	<th>Y</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>7</td>
	<td>6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>3</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>7</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
	<h2>One Rule</h2>
	Mathematical Functions in math have one rule. That rule is that an input has one output. In other words, an input cannot have multiple outputs…
	<table>
	<tr>
	<th>X</th>
	<th>Y</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>7</td>
	<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>7</td>
	<td>9</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
This function has one number (7) that has two separate inputs (1 & 9), therefore this isn’t a function.

<h2>Diagram Functions</h2>
Functions can also be shown as this…
<img src="../Images/MathFunc.img1.png">
If a function has a number that has two separate outputs, it is not a function. In this example, when 1 is the input, both 4 and 9 are the outputs which breaks the rule that functions cannot have one input that has multiple outputs.

<h2>Types of Mathematical Functions</h2>
There are many types of mathematical functions. One common type is linear functions…
<p>f(x) = 3x + 2</p>
<h3>Linear Functions</h3>
Linear functions are mathematical functions that have an unknown variable (usually with a coefficient) to to the power of 1.
<p>f(x) = 2x + 2</p>
The slope of linear functions is always the coefficient with the variable, the y-intercept is the whole number…
<p>y = 5x - 4</p>
This function has a slope of 5/1 and a y-intercept of -4.
<h3>Quadratic Functions</h3>
Quadratic Functions are mathematical functions that have an unknown variable (usually with a coefficient) to the power of 2…
<p>x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 5</p>
The coefficient for the squared variable cannot equal zero.

<h3>Polynomial Functions</h3>
Polynomial functions are functions that contain a coefficient with a variable to a power greater than one like this one…
<p>f(x) = 3x<sup>2</sup> + 2x - 1</p>

<h2>Finding Missing Inputs and Outputs</h2>
For some problems, a piece of the function is missing and you would have to find out that missing piece. This could include inputs and outputs.
<h3>Finding Missing Inputs</h3>
To find a missing input, you can turn the function into an x = y format...
<p>f(x) = 29</p>
<p>3x - 4</p>
<p>3x - 4 = 29</p>
Now solve the equation like a linear equation...
<p>3x - 4 = 29</p>
<p>3x = 33</p>
<p>x = 11</p>
<p>f(11) = 29</p>
Now if we input 11, we get 29 therefore, x = 11.
<h3>Finding Missing Outputs</h3>
To find a missing output, substitude x as the input...
<p>f(11) = ???</p>
<p>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 2</p>
<p>2(11)<sup>2</sup> + 3(11) - 2</p>
<p>242 + 33 - 2</p>
<p>275 - 2</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>f(11) = 273</p>
So when we input 11, we get 273.
