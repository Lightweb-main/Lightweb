	<h1>Trigonometric Identities</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Trigonometric Identities are a set of equalities that contain trigonometric functions and are always true in every trigonometric equation.

<h2>Sine, Cosine, and Tangent</h2>
Sine, Cosine and Tangent are the three main functions in trigonometry, they also have their own formulas when it comes to the sides of triangles.

<h3>Sine (sin)</h3>
In trigonometry, sine (shortened to sin) has one formula that remains the same…
The sine of a given angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. For example, if this triangle's opposite side is 3 and the Hypotenuse is 5, sin(θ) equals 3/5.

<h3>Cosine (cos)</h3>
In trigonometry, Cosine (shortened to Cos) has one formula that remains the same…
The cosine of a given angle is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse side. For example, if the adjacent side is 8 and the hypotenuse is 12, then sin(θ) equals 8/12.

<h3>Tangent (tan)</h3>
In trigonometry, Tangent (shortened to Tan) has a few formulas that remain the same…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img3.png">
The tangent of a given angle is the opposite side over the adjacent side. For example if the triangle's opposite side is 9 and the adjacent is 13, then tan(θ) equals 9/13. Tangent also has other formulas that are equal to each other…

<h2>Coscant, Secant, Cotangent</h2>
Coscant, Secant and Cotangent are three trigonometry functions that are reciprocals to the main three trigonometric functions.

<h2>Coscant (Csc)</h2>
In trigonometry, cosecant (shortened to Csc) is the reciprocal of sine…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img5.png">
The cosecant of a given angle is the hypotenuse side over the opposite side. For example, if sin(θ) is 24/18, then cosecant would be 18/24. Cosecant can also be 1 over sin(θ) and sin can also be 1 over csc(θ)...

<h2>Secant (Sec)</h2>
In trigonometry, Secant (shortened to sec) is the reciprocal of cosine…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img7.png">
The secant of a given angle is the hypotenuse side over the adjacent side. For example, if the cosine of a given angle is 16/20, the-
n the secant of that angle is 20/16. And same for cosecant, secant and cosine can have other formulas…

<h2>Cotangent (cot)</h2>
Cotangent (shortened to cot) is the reciprocal of tangent hence its name…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img9.png">
The cotangent of a given angle is the adjacent side over the opposite side. For example, if the tangent of an angle is 12/22, then the cotangent is 22/12. Also cotangent has other formulas equivalent to each other…

<h2>Pythagoreans/Sqaured Identities</h2>
The Pythagorean Identities (or called Pythagoras Identities) is a fundamental formula in all of mathematics itself, it is used to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img11.png">
In trigonometry, we can use this formula for trig functions. For example, we can divide every term by c<sup>2</sup>…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img12.png">
And if we divide all the terms by c<sup>2</sup> we end up with a<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> = 1…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img13.png">
And this leads into the first pythagoras theorem as a<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> can equal (a/c)2 which can be (opposite / hypotenuse)2 which can turn into sin<sup>2</sup>…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img14.png">
This brings us to one of the Pythagoras Identities, where cos<sup>2</sup>(θ)  + sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) equals 1 since a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = 1…

<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img16.png">
<br>
There’s two other identities that are related to this identity with sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) + cos<sup>2</sup>(θ)  = 1. There’s a relation between secant and tan…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img17.png">
This identity can be proved by the formula that we covered earlier…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img18.png">
We first divide every term by cos<sup>2</sup>(θ)...
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img19.png">
cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) divided by itself is 1, sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) divided by cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) can be rewritten as tan<sup>2</sup>(θ)  since tan can equal sin(θ) over cos(θ), and 1 over cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) can be rewritten as sec<sup>2</sup>(θ) since secant is the reciprocal of cosine...
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img20.png">
You can also divide every term by sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) to get a different trig identity…
There are also other identities by moving some terms around…
<br><br><img src="../Images/TrigId.img21.png">
These trigonometry identities are commonly referred to as "squared trigonometry identities” and these are fundamental in trigonometry.
