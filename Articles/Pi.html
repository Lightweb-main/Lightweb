		<h1>Pi</h1> 
<h2>Iùúãtroduction</h2>
ùúã is a constant value in math used to calculate circular properties like circumference. Pi has a value of 3.14159 and more digits soon follow. Pi doesn‚Äôt have a truly known value, millions of digits are in pi and are simplified to 3.14. Pi represents the ratio between the diameter to circumference. Pi is used in advanced mathematical concepts from geometry to trigonometry to calculus. Pi is considered an irrational number since it can‚Äôt be written as a fraction, while some fraction come close to the value, not a single one has the exact same value as it.

<h2>22/7</h2> 
22/7 as a fraction is commonly substituted as pi since the fraction itself has a value approximately but not exactly pi.

<h2>355/113</h2>
355 divided by 113 is the closest value to pi, off by 0.009%. The reason why it‚Äôs so special is that it is the closest fraction to pi and not off by a lot. Both 355/113 start with 3.14159, then 355/113 is a little bit bigger than pi since it is 3.14159292, while pi is 3.14159265.
