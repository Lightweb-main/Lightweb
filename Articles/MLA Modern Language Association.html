		<h1>MLA: Modern Language Association</h1>
	<p>MLA (also known as Modern Language Association) is a style of documentation that many schools use to format documents, essays, and many more. Since the rise of digital devices that can allow the user to type entire essays into documents many styles of documentation surfaced and one of the most famous and used ones for educational purposes is MLA formatting. MLA is a group of principles that the user has to follow for neat, easy to read and organized writing. 
First thing when a user starts typing an essay in MLA formatting, double spacing (this doesn’t mean pressing enter for every line)and indentation in each paragraph is implemented into the document making it easier to read and making it more formal. Next margins in the document is set to 1 inch, if you are typing this on google docs which is the example right now, you can set margins through file then page setup. Also you would have noticed by now that the font size is 12, the font size for any MLA writing always has a font size of 12, this font size is kept throughout the entire writing. Before the start of an essay, a heading is used above and to the left of the title. The heading has your name, your instructor's name, the class name so for example if you’re in 7th grade ELA Honors then put “ELA 7H”, and finally at the bottom of the heading, put the date with the day being first then the month second and the year being last (ex. 29 December 2024). 
Next when you have your heading, header, title, and the other principles all set up and you’re ready to start, makes sure that the entire essay is NOT BOLDED (unless instructed otherwise but just to be safe don’t), the essay text (excluding the title) should be aligned to the left, if not already select the entire essay up to the title and go into align & indent and click on the option that says “Left Align”. Your font should be standardized (Arial, Times New Roman, Georgia). One more note is that your header includes your last name and the page number of your document. Now you might be asking “I don’t want to do all of this for just formatting”, well if you don’t you could get penalized or even marked a 0 if you are required to do MLA formatting for an assignment or anything else. Also if you are not familiar with an MLA example then the essay that you just read is an example.</p>
