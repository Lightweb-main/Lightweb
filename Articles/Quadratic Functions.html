		<h1>Quadratic Functions</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
A Quadratic function is a quadratic equation that is represented by a U-shaped line on a coordinate graph like this one…

		The shape of a quadratic function is called a parabola which is a U-shaped figure that gets thinner and thinner relative to the x value.

Like a quadratic, these follow the same standard form and a is a nonzero number…
<p>f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</p>
<p>a ≠ 0</p>
A quadratic function may either open above or below depending on if it has a positive or negative value…

<p>This is when a is a positive value</p>

<p>This is when a is a negative value</p>
<h2>Graphing a Quadratic Function</h2>
Now graphing a quadratic function takes a lot of steps but isn’t impossible to do. A quadratic function has many elements, examples would be y-intercepts, x-intercepts, the vertex and more.
<h3>Y-intercept</h3>
To calculate the y-intercept in a quadratic function, you would substitute x as 0. So for example, f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3, substitute x as 0…
<p>2(0)2 + 3(0) + 3 </p>
<p>0 + 0 + 3 = 3</p>
In this example, the Y-intercept is 3.

A more straightforward formula for finding the Y-intercept in a quadratic function is…
<p>(0, c)</p>
<h3>X-intercept(s)</h3>
The X-intercept(s) in a quadratic function are the point/points that cross the x-axis. To calculate the x-intercepts, substitute f(x), y or whatever the quadratic is equal to as 0…
<p>f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3</p>
<p>y =  2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3</p>
<p>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3 = 0</p>
And solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula…

Looks like the roots of this quadratic are imaginary, this means that the quadratic function doesn’t have x-intercepts at all because no points cross the x-axis. If the roots are not imaginary numbers, then the parabola has points that cross the x-axis somewhere on the graph.

<h3>Vertex</h3>
The vertex is the highest point (if a is a negative) or the lowest point (if a is a positive). There are two values that are needed to be solved in order to find the x and y values of the vertex. First is the x-coordinate of the vertex which is…
<p>x = -b/2a</p>
X is -b over 2a. An example would be…
<p>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3</p>
Substitute the values into the formula…
 <p>-3/4</p>
The x-coordinate of the vertex is -3/4. Finding the y-coordinate of the vertex involves substituting x with the answer from -b/2a which is -3/4…
<p>f(-3/4) = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3</p>
<p>= 1.125 - 2.25</p>
<p>= –1.125 + 3</p>
<p>= 1.875</p>

The vertex is at (-3/4, 15/8).
