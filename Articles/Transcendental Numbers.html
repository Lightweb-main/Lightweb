		<h1>Transcendental Numbers</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Transcendental numbers are real or complex, irrational numbers that cannot be a solution to an algebraic equation (non-algebraic) and are not a root of a polynomial.

		<h2>Examples</h2>
Examples of transcendental numbers are mathematical constants such as pi and euler since both cannot be roots of polynomials, irrational and are non-algebraic. The Liouville Constant is another example of a transcendental number. The natural logarithm of 2 is also a transcendental number. Finding a transcendental number isnâ€™t that rare since simply choosing a random number is almost guaranteed to be a transcendental number.
