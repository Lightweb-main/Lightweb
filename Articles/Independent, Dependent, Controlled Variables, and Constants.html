	<h1>Independent, Dependent, <br>Controlled Variables and Constants</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Independent, Dependent, Controlled Variables, and Constants are all quantities that are included in experiments and collecting data.
	<h2>Independent Variables</h2>
	Independent Variables are variables that are changed to observe its effect on dependent variables. An example of an independent variable would be...
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">An experiment that measures the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from the mixture of Vinegar and Baking Soda</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Independent Variables: The amount of vinegar/baking soda added.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Dependent Variables: The amount of carbon dioxide gas created.</p>
	Think of the independent variable being the <b>cause</b> portion in cause-effect.
	<h2>Dependent Variables</h2>
	Dependent Varaibles are variables that are affected by the change of independent variables. The dependent variable is what is mesaured and is used to find the relationship between it and its independent variable...
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">An experiment that measures the total amount of force (N) acting on an object after colliding with the same object at different speeds.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Independent Variables: Acceleration.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Dependent Variables: The amount of force that is acted.</p>
	Think of the independent variable being the <b>effect</b> portion in cause-effect.
	<h2>Controlled Variables</h2>
	Controlled variables are variables that are kept constant or controlled throughout the experiment. Unlike independent variables, controlled variables are meant to be kept constant or controlled, but both types of varaibles are changed, intentionally or not...
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">An experiment that compares the impact of sunlight time on an plant's height</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Independent Variables: Amount of Sunlight Time</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Dependent Variables: The height of the plant.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Controlled Variables: The amount of water given (no precipitation)</p>
	<h2>Constants</h2>
	Constants are varaibles that <b>cannot</b> be changed. They're similar to controlled variables but cannot be affected throughout the experiment. For example...
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">An experiment that measures the amount of time an object hits the surface when dropped at a certain altitude.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Independent Variables: Altitude of where the object was dropped.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Dependent Variables: Amount of time until the object collided with the surface.</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Controlled Variables: Wind speed (time of experiment)</p>
	<p style="font-size: 15px;">Constant: Earth's Gravity (9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)</p>
