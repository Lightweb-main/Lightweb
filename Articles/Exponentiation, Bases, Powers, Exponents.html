		<h1 class='smallHeading1'>Exponentiation, Powers, Bases, and Exponents</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Exponents are the third hyperoperation in mathematics which is known for having a  number multiplied by itself a numerous amount of times…
<p>2<sup>3</sup></p>
The bigger number in exponentiation is called the base number…
<p>2<sup>3</sup></p>
The smaller number to the upper right side in exponentiation is called the exponent…
<p>2<sup>3</sup></p>
Both of them together are called a power…
<p>2<sup>3</sup></p>

<h2>Solving Exponents</h2>
Now exponents can reach big numbers much quicker than multiplication does, for example…
<p>4<sup>3</sup></p>
We can see that the base is 4 and the exponent is 3. One method is to convert the two numbers to multiplication (However the exponent may be too large to make the power to be rewritten to multiplication). This is telling us that the value of 4 to the power of 3 is just 4 * 4 * 4, or 4 times itself three times…
<p>4<sup>3</sup> = 4 * 4 * 4</p>
Since this is now multiplication, it is easier to solve…
<p>4<sup>3</sup> = 4 * 4 * 4</p>
<p>= 16 * 4</p>
<p>= 64</p>
So 4 to the power of 3 is 64…
<p>4<sup>3</sup> = 64</p>
Another example would be 3 to the power of 7…
<p>3<sup>7</sup></p>
Since the exponent is small enough, multiplication can be used…
<p>3<sup>7</sup> = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3</p>
<p>= 9 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3</p>
<p>= 27 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3</p>
<p>= 81 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3</p>
<p>= 24<sup>3</sup> * 3 * 3 * 3</p>
<p>= 729 * 3 * 3</p>
<p>= 2187 * 3</p>
<p>= 6561</p>
3 to the power of 7 is 6561.

<h2>Multiplying and Dividing Powers</h2>
Powers can be multiplied by other powers like this one…
<p>x<sup>3</sup> * x<sup>2</sup> = ???</p>
The rule to multiplying two powers together, the product is the base on both multipliers with both exponents adding together…
<p>x<sup>a</sup> * x<sup>b</sup> = x<sup>a + b</sup></p>
So in this example we just add two of the exponents, 3 and 2…
<p>x<sup>3</sup> * x<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>5</sup></p>
The product of x<sup>3</sup> plus x<sup>2</sup> is x5. </p>

Sometimes the exponents can be the same but the bases aren’t…
<p>5<sup>12</sup> * 3<sup>12</sup> = ???</p>
Instead of keeping the bases and multiplying the exponents, we do the opposite…
<p>5<sup>12</sup> * 3<sup>12</sup> = 15<sup>12</sup></p>
The answer is 15 to the power of 12.

If both the bases and the exponents are different from each other, find the answers to both powers then multiply…
<p>3<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = ???</p>
<p>3 * 3 * 3 = 27</p>
<p>2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32</p>
<p>33 + 25 = 27 + 32 = 59</p>
<p>3<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 59</p>
If you are dividing exponents instead of multiplying, you do the opposite and instead subtract the exponents…
<p>x<sup>5</sup> / x<sup>3</sup> = x<sup>5 - 3</sup>= x<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>x<sup>a</sup> / x<sup>b</sup>= x<sup>a - b</sup></p>
Multiplying Powers With Multiple Numbers/Variables
Sometimes a math problem with exponentiation can have multiple numbers and variables like this one…
<p>2<sup>3</sup>x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>7</sup>(25x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup>)</p>
This can be solved by adding the exponents on every power…
<p>2<sup>3+5</sup>x<sup>2+3</sup>y<sup>7+2</sup>= 28x<sup>5</sup>y<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>= 256x<sup>5</sup>y<sup>9</sup></p>
If you are simplifying the equation, it is 2<sup>8</sup>x<sup>5</sup>y<sup>9</sup>. If you are evaluating the equation, it is 256x5y9, both are equal to each other since 28 equals 256…


<h2>Raising a Power to another Power</h2>
Raising a power to another power is basically exponentiation with a power…
<p>(2<sup>3</sup>)<sup>5</sup></p>
To find the answer, multiply the exponents together…
<p>(x<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup> = x<sup>a * b</sup></p>
<p>(2<sup>3</sup>)<sup>5</sup> = 2<sup>15</sup></p>
So 2 to the power of 3 to the power of 5 equals 2 to the power of 5.

With one number/variable in the brackets (excluding the exponent), this is simple but things change with two or more numbers in the brackets like this one…
<p>(24x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup>)<sup>5</sup></p>
Do the same thing with multiplying every exponent in the brackets by 5…
<p>(24x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup>)5 = 220x<sup>15</sup>y<sup>10</sup></p>
<h2>Raising a Power to many other Powers</h2>
This section of the google doc is basically raising a power to a power to a power, basically repeated exponentiation…
<p>(((3<sup>1</sup>x<sup>4</sup>y<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3</sup>)<sup>6</sup>) = ???</p>
Quick note before solving this is that with parentheses…
<p>3<sup>3<sup>3</sup></sup> ≠ (3<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3</sup></p>
The parentheses matter a lot because in PEMDAS, parentheses go first which means that 3 to the power of 3 on the right side goes first…
<p>3<sup>3</sup>3</sup></sup>≠ (27)<sup>3</sup></p>
With the equation on the left, since there aren't any parentheses, meaning that the first, larger exponent gets multiplied by itself…
<p>3<sup>27</sup>≠ (27)<sup>3</sup></p>
Since 3 to the power of 27 is much, much larger than 27 to the power of 3, they aren’t equal. Back to the problem above…
<p>(((3<sup>1</sup>x<sup>4</sup>y<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3</sup>)<sup>6</sup>) </p>
First we multiply the exponents by three…
<p>((3<sup>3</sup>x<sup>12</sup>y<sup>9</sup>)<sup>6</sup>) </p>
Then we multiply the exponents by six…
<p>(3<sup>18</sup>x<sup>72</sup>y<sup>54</sup>) </p>
So the answer is 3 to the power of 18 times x to the power of 72 times y to the power of 54…
<p>(3<sup>18</sup>x<sup>72</sup>y<sup>54</sup>) = (((3<sup>1</sup>x<sup>4</sup>y<sup>3</sup>)<sup>3</sup>)<sup><sup>6</sup></sup>)</p>
