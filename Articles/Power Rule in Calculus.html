		<h1>Power Rule in Calculus</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
The power rule in calculus is a formula used to find the derivatives of a variable exponentiated. The power rule can be used to find derivatives and the antiderivatives have different formulas…

<p>d/dx= nx<sup>n - 1</sup></p> 
<p>∫x<sup>n</sup>dx= x<sup>n+1</sup>/ n+1</p>

<h2>Derivatives</h2>
An example of the power rule in derivatives would be…
<p>What is d/dx(x<sup>3</sup> + x)?</p>

<p>d/dx x<sup>3</sup> + 1x</p>
In differential calculus, the power rule is very simple. You multiply the coefficient by the exponent…
<p>x<sup>3</sup> + 1x —> 3x<sup>3</sup> + 1x</p>
After that the power of each base is subtracted by 1…
<p>3x<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>0</sup> = 3x<sup>2</sup> + 1</p>

<p>d/dx x<sup>3</sup> + 1x = 3x<sup>2</sup> + 1</p>
Another example would be…
<p>d/dx(2x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + 3)</p>
The first step would be to multiply all the coefficients with their respective powers…
<p>6x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3</p>
Then we find the derivatives of all the values inside the parentheses…
<p>d/dx(2x<sup>3</sup>) = 6x<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>d/dx(x<sup>2</sup>) = 2x</p>
<p>d/dx(3) = 0 </p>
<p>The derivative is 6x<sup>2</sup> + 2x</p>
<h2>Antiderivatives</h2>
The power rule can also be used on antiderivatives, however the formula is very different…
<p>∫x<sup>n</sup> dx = x<sup>n+1</sup> / n+1</p>
To get the antiderivative of an equation, you would have to increase the power by 1 and divide it by the same sum. For example…
<p>∫12x<sup>6</sup>dx </p>
First we increase the power by 1…
<p>12x<sup>7</sup></p>
Then we divide it by 7 since the new power is 7…
<p>12x<sup>7</sup> / 7</p>
The antiderivative of 12x<sup>6</sup> is 12x<sup>7</sup> divided by 7 + C…
<p>∫12x6dx  = 12x<sup>7</sup> / 7 + C</p>
