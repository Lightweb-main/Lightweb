		<h1>Triangle Inequality Theorem</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Triangle Inequality Theorem is a set of formulas used to see if a triangle can be drawn by the length of its sides. 

<h2>Formula(s)</h2>
The formula for the triangle inequality theorem is…
<p>AB < BC + CA </p>
<p>BC < AB + CA </p>
<p>CA < AB + BC </p>
The theorem states that every side of a triangle must be smaller than the sum of the other two sides. Take a triangle as an example…

The triangle has three known sides. This triangle satisfies the triangle inequality theorem as each side is smaller than the sum of the others…
<p>18 < 14 + 23</p>
<p>23 < 18 + 14</p>
<p>14 < 18 + 23</p>
All the sums are bigger than their respective sides.
<br><br>
Now for a triangle that doesn’t satisfy the triangle inequality theorem…

As you can see, there is a gap between AB and BC…

This is because AC is longer than both AB and BC combined…
<p>63 > 28 + 20</p>
This does not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem so a triangle with these sides cannot exist. 
<br><br>
Now a situation where the sum of two sides is equal to one side…
<img src='../Images/TriIneqTheo.img4.png'>
If two sides are equal to one side, that means that the triangle is just a straight line instead of a triangle. This is because both AB and BC cover the same distance together as AC.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The triangle inequality theorem is used to find out if a triangle with three known sides can geometrically exist. If one side is longer than the sum of the two others, the triangle cannot geometrically exist.
