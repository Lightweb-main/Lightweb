		<h1>Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion are both measures used to describe and summerize data. Each measure shows a different value in data.
		<h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
		Measures of Central Tendency are measures that represent a central or typical value in a dataset. Measures of Central Tendency include Mean, Median, and Mode since they all either measure the central (median and mean) or the typical value (mode).
		<h2>Measures of Dispersion</h2>
		Measures of Dispersion are measures that represent the spread, scatter, or varibility of a datset. These include, Range, Variance, Standard Deviation (SD), Mean Deviation/Mean Absolute Deviation, and Quartile Deviation. All of these calculate the distance between two values unlike measures of central tendency focus on one central/typical value.
