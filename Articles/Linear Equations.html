		<h1>Linear Equations</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		Linear Equations are algebraic equations that involve complex mathematical numerals such as the introduction of variables.
		<h2>Solving a Linear Equation</h2>
There is a common way to solve linear equations by substitution and the process of elimination. Let's say we had an example of a linear equation…
<p>e + 3  = 8</p>
Now normally this would normally be confusing to you if you have never seen it, the letters that are in math are typically the value that we are trying to solve. To simplify this equation we subtract 3 from both sides…
<p>e = 5</p>
And the value of e is 5. But let's say that the equation is a subtraction problem
<p>e - 6 = 27</p>
Right now we can’t confirm the value of e yet. When doing an addition problem, you subtract from both sides but since subtraction is the opposite of addition, we add 6 to both sides…
<p>e = 33</p>
The value of e is 33. But let's solve a more complex equation…
<p>3e + 20 = 41</p>
This linear equation involves multiplication and addition in this problem. First we subtract twenty from both sides…
<p>3e = 21</p>
Now we see that 3e equals 21, and 21 is divisible by 3. You can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by three.
<p>z = 7</p>
You can also check the answer by putting in the number in place of the variable, so for this example…
<p>21 + 20 = 41</p>
This equation is true which means that the value “7” is the solution for this equation. Sometimes the equation can have variables on both sides like this one…
<p>z + 14 = 2z + 4</p>
For this equation first let's remove the 2z on the right side…
<p>-z + 14 = 4</p>
When you are trying to have the variable on the left side isolated, you might encounter a negative variable, if you see this, just ignore it. And ALWAYS remove the variable on the right side, if the right side variable is positive you must subtract from both sides, if the right side variable is negative you must add to both sides.
<p>-z = -18</p>
Now let's solve a very complex problem…
<p>5 - (9x + 7) = 28 + 6x</p>
Now this may seem complex but the solution is a whole integer. First we would get rid of the five at the beginning of the equation. To do this, we can subtract five from 7.

<p>-9x - 2 = 28 + 6x</p>
Notice that the 9x is negative, this is because in the equation, 9x has a minus sign on the left of it. If you see a minus sign on the left of a number, it is a negative number, same with positive signs with numerals. Next we would have to remove the negative 2 on the left side. 
<p>-9x = 30 + 6x</p>
Now we have two variables on both sides but only one numeral in the middle of the equations. In this example we would have to remove the 6x in the equation. To do this we would have to imagine that we are doing -9x minus 6x. 
<p>-15x = 30 </p>
Now that the equation is simplified, we would just have to divide both sides by 15 to make the x variable on its own.
<p>-x = 2</p>
When you see a negative variable, just multiply by -1 on both sides since a negative times a negative equals a positive.
<p>x = -2</p>
