		<h1>Factoring Quadratics</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
Factoring is breaking apart an equation into its factors that multiply together to make up the equation like this one…
<p>x<sup>2</sup> + x - 42 = 0 </p>
<p>(x + 7)(x - 6)</p>
To factor a quadratic equation, look at an equation like this one…
<p>x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 18 = 0</p>
To form a quadratic, two 1x values multiplied together is x<sup>2</sup> however the coefficient values may vary the equation…
<p>(x)(x) = x<sup>2</sup></p>
To get b and c in a quadratic, find two numbers that multiply to c but add up to b’s coefficient. In other words, two numbers must multiply to -18 but add up to 3…
<p>(x + 6)(x - 3) = x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 18</p>
The numbers +6 and -3 both add to 3 which is b, and multiply to -18 which is c. So x + 6 times x - 3 is x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 18 factored…
<p>x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 18 = 0  = (x + 6)(x - 3)</p>
Factorization isn’t to simplify the equation, it can be used to get the roots of the quadratic equation. To get a factored quadratic’s roots, get each of the factors and equal them to zero…
<p>x + 6 = 0</p>
<p>x - 3 = 0</p>
Solve them like linear equations…
<p>x + 6 = 0</p>
<p>x = -6</p>

<p>x - 3 = 0</p>
<p>x = 3</p>
The roots for x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 18 are -6 and 3.

Keep in mind that some quadratic equations cannot be factored as two numbers that add up to c and multiply two b are not possible. Always use the quadratic formula when factorization isn’t possible.
