	<h1>All Forms of Linear Functions</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	This is a linear equation...
	<p>2x + 3 = -5</p>
	A linear equation can also be a <b>linear function</b> which is shown as a straight line on a graph like this one...

	A linear function can be expressed in many forms like <b>slope-intercept form</b>...
	<p>y = mx + b</p>
	<p>y = 3x + 2</p>
	Or in <b>point-slope</b> form...
	<p>y - y<sub>1</sub> = m(x - x<sub>x</sub>)</p>
	<p>y - 5 = 2(x - 2)</p>
	<p>y - 5 = 2x - 4</p>
	<p>y = 2x + 1</p>
	Or in <b>Standard Form</b>...
	<p>Ax + By = C</p>
	<p>5x + 4y = 3</p>
	<p>-4y = 5x + 3</p>
	<p>-y = -5/4x + 0.75</p>
	<p>y = 5/4x - 3/4</p>
	There are many forms of linear functions but all of them equate the same.
	<h2>Slope-Intercept Form</h2>
	Slope-intercept form is the most common way of writing linear functions as it shows the slope and the y-intercept...
	<p>y = mx + b</p>
	This form of linear functions shows the slope and as m the y-intercept as b. So for example...
	<p>y = -2x + 5</p>
	In this example, the slope is -2, meaning that every time x increases by 1, y decreases by 2. And the y-intercept is 5, meaning that when x = 0, y = 5.
	<h3>Converting Slope-Intercept Form to Point-Slope Form</h3>
	To convert slope-intercept to point-slope, first substitute a points coordinate into the point-slope form, take this function for example...
	<p>y = 1/3x - 5</p> 
	We can use (0, -5) for example as the y-intercept is 5. Then we can plug in these coordinates into the point-slope form itself...
	<p>y - y<sub>1</sub> = m(x - x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
	<p>y - (-5) = m(x - 0)</p>
	Lastly, we'll substitute m as the slope of the function (which is 1/3)...
	<p>y + 5 = 1/3(x - 0)</p>
	<p>y + 5 = 1/3x</p>
	<h3>Converting Slope-Intercept Form to Standard Form</h3>
	To convert slope-intercept form to standard form, first move x to the left alongside it's coefficent, for example...
	<p>y = 3/2x - 2</p>
	Move 3/2x to the left by subtracting it on both sides...
	<p>-3/2x + y = -2</p>
	This is the standard form for y = 3/2x - 2, optionally, you can multiply -2 on both sides and or add 2 on both sides...
	<p>Multiplying -2 on both sides</p>
	<p>3x - 2y = 4</p>
	<p>Add 2 on both sides</p>
	<p>-3/2x + y + 2 = 0</p>
	<p>Doing both</p>
	<p>3x - 2y - 4 = 0</p>
	<h2>Point-Slope Form</h2>
	The point-slope form is another form of a linear function as it is written like this...
	<p>y - y<sub>1</sub> = m(x - x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
	Like this one for example...
	<p>y - 5 = 2(x - 1)</p>
	Which can be simplified to...
	<p>y - 5 = 2x - 2</p>
	<p>y - 3 = 2x</p>
	The m represents the slope of the line, so the slope of this line is 2. The x<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>1</sub> are the coordinates of a point that lies on the line so for example for this linear function, (1, 5) lies on the line which can then be used for the values of both values, x<sub>1</sub> = 1, y<sub>1</sub> = 5...
	<h3>Converting Point-Slope Form to Slope-Intercept Form</h3>
	To convert point-slope form to slope-intercept form, first plug in a point that lies on the line, so for example...
	<p>y - y<sub>1</sub> = -1(x - x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
	Lets say that (-2, 5) lies on the line, so we would plug in those values into the equation...
	<p>y - 5 = -1(x + 2)</p>
	Then simplify...
	<p>y - 5 = -x - 2</p>
	<p>y - 3 = -x</p>
	Now lets add 3 on both sides to remove the -3 on the left...
	<p>y = -x + 3</p>
	So y - 5 = -1(x + 2) is y = -x + 3 in slope-intercept form.
	<h3>Converting Point-Slope Form to Standard Form</h3>
	To convert point-slope form to standard form, first subtract x on both sides, for example...
	<p>y + 2 = 4(-2x - 1)</p>
	To start, lets simplify the equation...
	<p>y + 2 = -8x - 4</p>
	Now lets add 8x on both sides to remove the -8x on the right...
	<p>8x + y + 2 = -4</p>
	Now we've converted this into Standard Form and we can even convert it to the general form Ax + By + C = 0
	<p>8x + y + 6 = 0</p>
	<h2>Standard Form</h2>
	Standard Form is also another way how to express linear functions. However this form doesn't need the slope of a linear function...
	<p>Ax + By + C = 0</p>
	Here are some examples...
	<p>-3x + 2y + 2 = 0</p>
	<p>2x - y - 5 = 0</p>
	<p>5x + 7y - 1 = 0</p>
	<p>x + 3y + 3 = 0</p>
	<h2>Converting Standard Form to Slope-Intercept Form</h2>
	To convert standard form to slope-intercept form, first isolate the y to the left, for example...
	<p>30x + 10y - 20 = 0</p>
	Lets move 10y on the left...
	<p>-10y = 30x - 20</p>
	Now lets simplify the equation.
	<p>y = -3x + 2</p>
	So 30x + 10y - 20 = 0 in standard form is y = -3x + 2 in slope-intercept form.
	<h2>Converting Standard Form to Point-Slope Form</h2>
	To convert standard form to point-slope form, we would first have to convert the linear function to slope-intercept form first, for example...
	<p>12x + 3y = 9</p>
	Lets convert this to slope-intercept form...
	<p>12x + 3y - 9 = 0</p>
	<p>-3y = 12x - 9</p>
	<p>y = -4x + 3</p>
	Now that we've converted it to slope-intercept, we can now convert it to point-slope form. From this we can see that the y-intercept is 3, so we can use (0, 3) as the point for the point-slope form...
	<p>y - 3 = m(x - 0)</p>
	We can also see that the slope is -4, so we can plug that in as well...
	<p>y - 3 = -4(x - 0)</p>
	So this is the linear function in point-slope form, but we can simplify it even further...
	<p>y - 3 = -4x</p>
