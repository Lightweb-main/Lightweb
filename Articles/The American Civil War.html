		<h1>The American Civil War</h1>
		<h2>Introduction & Cause</h2>
The American Civil War was a conflict between the Confederacy (South) and the Union (North) in the United States. The war was mainly active when the friction of ideals between slavery since the South was mainly dependent on slavery and labor meanwhile the North wanted to end slavery. This built up friction between ideals of slavery between the Confederacy and the Union eventually escalated into a war between the two parties. The Civil war started in 1861 and lasted 4 years, eventually ending in 1865. 
<h2>Economical Differences</h2>
Another major factor to the Civil war was that both sides had very different economical states. The northern states had a flourishing economy, which was abundant in technology that was in the industrial ages. While the southern states were the opposite, slaves in these states were farmers and were labored for little to no profit. 
<h2>Abraham Lincoin</h2>
Abraham Lincoin was an important person that went into office as the 15th president of the United States and led the Union through the Civil War eventually prevailing over the Confederacy. But shortly after this victory, Abraham was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth which sparked celebration to the Confederacy while it brought grief to the opposing Northern states.

<h2>Jefferson Davis</h2>
Jefferson Davis was another important person that was the leader of the Confederacy from its existence all the way until its downfall in the Civil War. Davis after the American Civil War was sentenced to prison for two years for committing treason but was never tried. His first act as the President of the Confederacy was to form a peace treaty to Washington, D.C., to stop any armed conflict. Once reluctantly giving the order to bomb Fort Sumter, the American Civil War had officially started and conflict between the two opposing sides were heating up in conflicts.
<h2>Battle of Fort Sumter</h2>
The Battle of Fort Sumter was the very first attack that took place in April from the Confederacy after Jefferson Davis reluctantly ordered the  bombing attack on Fort Sumter. The Union greatly valued Fort Sumter thus this attack prompted the Union states to retaliate against the Confederacy thus initiating the American Civil War. The result of this attack ended with the Confederacy winning over the Union.
<h2>Battle of Gettysburg </h2>
The Battle of Gettysburg was one of if not the most major battles in the American Civil War, the battle started on July 1st, 1863 to only last until July 3rd, 1863. This battle was the deadliest battle in the Civil war, accounting for up to 50,000 soldiers being killed, missing, or injured during the battle. Also after the war, topics like speaking to the dead, and subjects relating to the paranormal began flourishing as family members contacted dead loved ones in an attempt to communicate with them on the other side. Vast amounts of graveyards occupied farms and other open fields. Overall this battle was one of the most brutal battles ever to be fought in the American civil war as tens of thousands of people were injured and possibly a hundred thousand more were involved in the war. This battle was concluded with the Union overcoming the Confederacy.
