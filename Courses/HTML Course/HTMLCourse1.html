	<h1>To start, lets talk about the surface of HTML.</h1>
	HTML is an acronym for "Hyper Text Markup Language"! <br><br>
	Almost every website uses Hyper Text Markup Language, including this one!<br><br>
	HTML is often integrated with other languages like CSS and JS, they will be explained over this course.<br><br>
	HTML can be cohesive even to ones that are just starting computer science!<br><br>
	Fun Fact: All of Lightweb is programmed in HTML!<br><br>
