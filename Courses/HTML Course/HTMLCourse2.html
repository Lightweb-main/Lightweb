	<h1>Here are words that are often used within HTML</h1>
	There are several words that will come up during this course other than just HTML.
	Lets start with <b>tags</b>. <mark>Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They appear as text inside < angle brackets ></mark> just like this example...
	<p>< tag ><br></p>
	Everything in HTML <mark>has a starting tag to intiate it</mark>...
	<p>< startingtag ></p>
	Most tags have an <b>ending tag</b>...
	<p>< starting tag >< ending tag ></p>
	All ending tags have one thing distinctively different from starting tags. That difference is that <mark>every ending tag has a slash</mark> / between the text and the bracket...
	<p>< example >< /example > </p>
	Over this course, you will see a lot of different tags being used. And you will see this next term commonly also.<br><br>
	<b>Elements</b> <mark>are defined as the group containing a starting tag, text content, and an ending tag like this</mark>...
	<p> < exampleElement >Text Content< /exampleElement ></p>
	Another word that you will see alot is <b>style</b>...
	<p>< example style="text-align: center;"> < /example></p>
	Basically "style" or "styling" an element basically means that you are <mark>changing a property of an element like aligning the text content to align in the center just like the example above.
	<br><br>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
	<a href="HTMLCourse3.html">Next</a>
	</div>
