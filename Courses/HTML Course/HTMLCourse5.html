	<h1>HTML Declaration</h1>
	During the 1990s, computer programming wasn't as organized as today and many other languages were used. So to combat this problem, HTML 5 implemented the < !DOCTYPE html > tag.<br>
	The tag is primarily used to make computers show a site in a certain version of html. < !DOCTYPE html > is an extremely important tag that only is written once and is typed in the first row. <br>
	The downsides of not using < !DOCTYPE html > is that the browser defaults to quirk mode which may make some things render incorrectly.<br><br><br>
	<div style="text-align: center;">
